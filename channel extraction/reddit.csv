reddit,Python,"2-Button UI engine in MicroPython with ""Apps"" on a TTGO T-Display","https://youtu.be/wR3AkhD0nEg

More of a demo than anything at this point, but I've got working text entry, menus, loadable apps(any file named app_AppName.py is detected as an app).

I also have sleep modes, and wakelock-like functionality(Including modem sleep), and the ability for one app to launch another, with arguments and return values.

In screen-off sleep mode, it uses 6mA without Wi-Fi(The USB chip and charge led takes some power, probably more like 0.5mA on battery).  With Wi-Fi it's around 7mA with spikes every few seconds.

With the screen on, you get 45mA with spikes up to 65mA.  Probably room to improve that. But I'm impressed by the low power capabilities of MP(Once you add some assorted pull requests from the internet).

The Calculator app actually just launches the text entry app, and evals the text you enter.

There's a stopwatch and a tally counter, and a settings menu where you can customize things like the colors, and set an app to auto-load as soon as it boots up.

In the future, I'll add password protection to prevent exiting the default app, and I'd like to eventually have some kind of mobile ""App store"" Android app for uploading new content, and maybe the ability to configure WiFi/MDNS/MQTT from the settings menu.


The original idea for this was to be a replacement for Logitech's Harmony remotes.  I think it would be awesome to have an open source home automation remote, that used an app-capable OS, that could also be a replacement for smart wall switches.

Another fun thing I'd like to do is some kind of programming feature, so you could edit the logic for a little robot just with a 2 or 3 button menu.

If MicroPython ever gets BLE bonding, making a wireless keyboard emulator for media or presentations might be another fun app.",1650840886.0

reddit,Python,Anyone know the history of why strings are iterable?,"I think every intermediate Python programmer has had to learn the gotcha that you can't really duck-type iterables, because if you accidentally iterate over a string, Python will chug along perfectly fine despite it almost certainly not being the intended behavior. Even worse, because of the way collections ABCs are defined, a typing check like `isinstance(""a string"", collections.abc.Collection)` will still return True despite it almost certainly not being what is intended.

My question is whether anyone knows *the history* of why this is the case. Given the direction that the language was moving in, I would've thought it'd be a prime candidate for removal in the 2-to-3 transition. Obviously, there are use cases for iterating along elements of a string, but with Python 3 strings being unicode-by-default, the rich standard library, and the general high-level nature of the language, I don't see much of a use case at all. Certainly, I don't think it's contentious to say the drawbacks of making it the default behavior outweigh the benefits, with any real use cases easily accommodated by more specific `str.characters` or `str.bytes` methods.

So, what gives? Has this issue ever been actively discussed in the development of the language? Is it just a case of a holdover from earlier languages that was never really a big enough deal to get challenged? And why was it made even more formal with the introduction of `collections.abc`? Google-ing hasn't really provided any strong answers, so any stories or nuggets of info greatly appreciated!

**edit:** Maybe should have made it more clear that the question is really why strings are *still* iterable by default. I understand the history of strings as character arrays, and don't have a hard time imagining how that naturally made it into the language. But why that is still the case in Python 3 given that:

* It is a gotcha new users frequently run into (just search for people asking how to properly handle a `str` vs a `[str]` in a function argument)
* It doesn't *really* fit with how we think about the datatypes in Python (I doubt many Python programmers day-to-day think of a `str` as ""an ordered collection of `str` objects"")
* The uses for iterable-by-default seem limited given the wide builtin and standard library functionality available for `str` objects.",1650836526.0

reddit,Python,Speeding up python CLI's!,"so yesterday I was trying to make a python CLI that needed to be fast.

no matter what I did (`python -S`, pyinstaller, cx_freeze, bytecode compiling) it wouldnt be as fast as I needed it and some even made it slower like cx_freeze.

well I found a way to make running it much much faster (nearly instantaneous).

by using an asynchronous socket server and using netcat as input, you can give input to the server and recieve output immediately, since the script is already running

it works for windows and linux, but you may need cygwin on windows unless there is a built in timeout and netcat command I do not know about

how it works (on linux) is you define a bash function with this:
`hithere(){ printf ""$@"" | timeout 0.1 nc 127.0.0.1 50200; }`

and run the script: 
`python pyspeedtest.py`

to send input you run `hithere Mum` and you get `hi, Mum`

pyspeedtest.py
```
import pyspeed

class myhandler(pyspeed.pyspeed_handler):
    def handle_request(self, *argv):
        return f""hi, {argv[1]}""

handle = myhandler()
handle.run()
```

pyspeed.py
```python

- Cython converts Python into C and makes the code useable in both Python and C
- Numba directly converts Python into Machine code and is useful for Math operations (numpy)
- Numba is JIT compiler
- Both Cython and Numba don't support 3rd party libraries like Pandas and spacy..
- Pypy is an implementation of Python. Normally the Python we use when we write python abc.exe in cmd is Cpython(not Cython).
- Numba and Cython speed up the code a lot if the code is compatible... things like list don't work with Numba...

The library provides a bare minimal framework for expressing raw JSON-RPC queries as described in the Ethereum Specification and execute them together either concurrently (off-chain on the client side) or together as a batch (JSON-RPC batch specification on-chain). This method greatly reduces the time required to run large queries sequentially and thus can be used for use-cases where we need to index large number of transactions happening on ethereum blockchain in a local database for faster Web2 queries.

Last time, I introduced Autoencoders (using Keras) to develop a deep learning architecture that learns a low-dimensional representation of asteroid reflectance spectra.

Although I compressed the 49-dimensional spectra to only 2 dimensions, the results were quite fair. So... why did I compress it so ridiculously high? Well, a 2-D space can easily be visualized!

And this visualization is being done today. In today's tutorial, we'll use Matplotlib for a static display of the data, and ipwidgets, to create an interactive widget within our notebook on Google Colab! Let's see whether our 25-fold compression leads to some proper latent space, where the asteroid classes can be distinguished:

The next session will be the final one of the asteroid science project. There, we will create a higher dimensional latent space and apply some clustering algorithm to determine the number of asteroid classes from a data-scientific perspective. Stay tuned!

Historically, it was built to imitate then-popular Matlab. But I don't like Matlab either and consider it's API and plotting capabilities very inferior to e.g. Wolfram Mathematica.

reddit,Python,How Python Enriched the Use of AI in Several Industries,"Artificial intelligence and machine learning can be considered as the new backbones of the IT industry. While discussion over developing newer technologies to provide maximum safety continues, people innovate expanded abilities and capacities of artificial intelligence. [Artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) went from being a part of science fiction to a daily need of people worldwide. AI's added abilities have successfully reduced manual labor to a great extent and almost perfected the accuracy level. 

The amount of data produced increases its volume day by day, and the size has now become impossible to handle manually. AI helps analyze the data of many organizations to predict their future outcome and plan growth strategies accordingly. For example, many online websites have now launched the feature of chatbots that utilizes AI. This helps to enhance the customer experience. This shows how AI and machine learning efficiently and accurately process huge volumes of data for drawing in more customers.

Forming Future Technologies

The rising volume of data is increasing the complexity of data proportionately. As data becomes more complex, analyzing it manually becomes tougher. This machine intelligence is utilized to analyze and process the data for accurate results, and there is no limit to data. 

Using artificial intelligence mainly enhances three aspects of any organization. They are:

* Accuracy in predictions and insight production increases business efficiency.
* It is a very low-cost venture instead of hiring many individuals at high salaries.
* Finally, it increases the productivity of the organization.

This gives a precise reason why many companies use AI and machine learning to propel product development and improve the overall performance. Research has also discovered that using AI-laded technologies is the new trend in industrial transformation, particularly for enhancing the company. It has also concluded that within a few years, the companies that utilized AI in producing innovative products and processes are most likely to expand their grounds. To sum up, AI and machine learning produce better results while giving much smaller efforts. 

The Use of Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) checks off many boxes that result in being useful for AI and machine learning. Many features are present in Python, which makes it one of the best languages for these purposes. Thus, the knowledge of Python is important in the data science field as many industries use it to predict and analyze data. Python is open-source in nature, so AI development companies' achievements can be shared with the community. 

Some industries that extensively use Python in expanding their businesses are:

* Healthcare
* Travel and transportation
* Finance technology

Health Care

Health centers use data to scrutinize and diagnose their patients properly. The growing popularity of AI involvement in decrypting data leads to the rise in Python programmers' demand as it is the most popularly used program in the data science industry.

Travel and Transportation

Python and machine learning algorithms enable travel giants to predict airplane routes and behaviors easily. Therefore, implementing AI in the travel industry helps with customer efficiency, creating cost-effective budget plans, and setting the price details of new routes. 

Finance Technology

AI has also used its way in finance sectors to save from risks and frauds. Programming languages can detect any anomaly behavior and also helps in analyzing market behavior effectively.

I know tools already exist to do this but I just wanted a dirt-simple utility that I could say pipe the output of a script in to and it would just automatically send it to me in an email.

So over the weekend I wrote [PyMailer](https://github.com/UltraChip/PyMailer) \- a basic command-line utility written in Python3 that does exactly that. Now getting my server to notify me is as simple as adding

    cat /some/log/file/or/something | pymailer

to the end of a script. Configuration is accomplished by editing a JSON-esque config file - I tried to keep it as simple as possible.

Honestly it's nothing all that special - I banged it out in a couple hours - but it was a fun excuse to learn how to use argparse (especially figuring out how to read in data from stdin) as well as getting to play with Python's MIME and SMTP modules.

reddit,Python,I made a football simulation/game entirely using Python Turtle Graphics,"# Overview:

About a year ago i made a project called as ""Python Football Game"" which was just a Pong game on green background and goal posts it felt like cheating so this time i made an entire football game with 11 players and other rules etc in python turtle with about *629 lines of code* you can have a look at it here:

[Python Football Simulation In Turtle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rRYpX5-9RI) (Alternative Link Youtube)

You can do all sorts of things from passing ball to other teammates to scoring goals to switching players (inspired by fifa like mechanics) with throwing ball to a teammate if it goes outside etc. The team that scores 3 goals first wins you play against CPU with enemy having its own Logical AI it's a fun experience.

# Source Code:

[Project Source Code Here](https://github.com/JackhammerYT/Football-Simulation)

# Controls:

w(up) ,  a(left) ,  d(right) , s(down) ,  q(north west) ,  e(north east) ,  z(south west) ,  x(south east) Space Bar (Change Player) ,  Mouse Click (Pass the ball onto clicked position)

# Challenges:

Even though with how simple it's design was there were few challenges i learned to overcome, the biggest one being Calling a function after a delay without using threads. This was a rather hard challenge to overcome because turtle is not a thread safe framework that is all the GUI operations need to run on main thread and it so happened that i required to call a GUI operation with delay i solved it by making my own FunctionInvoker class based on time module that invokes a function after a delay you can see it's structure in ""[FunctionInvoker.py](https://FunctionInvoker.py)"" file on github repo",1650377093.0

    ```
    import dynamic_logger
    import logging
    logging.setLoggerClass(dynamic_logger.Logger)
    
    # Set-up log formatter with user-definied attributes
    fmt = '[%(asctime)s] &lt;%(app)s&gt; [%(levelname)s] &lt;%(id)s&gt; &lt;%(customer_id)s&gt; --- %(message)s' # Note: format attributes in &lt;&gt; are user-definited

    logging.basicConfig(format=fmt, datefmt='%d-%b-%y %H:%M:%S', level='INFO')
    
    applogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    
    @applogger.log_extras('id',int=0,customer_id='obj.customer_id') # Log value of 'id' and 'obj.customer_id'

reddit,Python,Are there any task queue libraries with the ergonomics of FastAPI,"## django is to FastAPI as celery is to `???`

We currently use FastAPI as our backend and Celery as our task/job queue. But I find it really clunky. Not that there's anything *wrong* with the Django/Celery way of doing things, but it doesn't jive with me. Everything is that old school loosey-goosey python style with kwargs and dynamic magic everywhere. It's sync so I need separate helper functions for all my IO work in the API, then another set for those in tasks. And I'm stuck with pass-by-import of all my IO, rather than DI, so I have to monkeypatch everything to unit test.

Oh and I know about background tasks, this needs to be a distributed task queue with separate agents.

Is there a task queue library out there with:

- static types, full coverage ideally
- Depends() style dependency injection, or similar
- async native

I've looked at RQ/ARQ and they are close to what I want but not quite.

Alternatively, are there any tips to get a better experience with Celery in the way of async, typing, and DI? I think it's getting better with the typing, but the lack of DI frustrates my unit test writing and makes it more convoluted.

reddit,Python,Weekly Algorithm Project: Middle Square Method,"Recently I started  a weekly algorithm project just to help me study new algorithms with a flair of good practice. This week I decided to focus on Python and the ""Middle Square Method"" a PRNG produced by John von Neuman in 1949. I further reiterated two attempted improvements to the algorithm that come from a couple of papers just last month: one using a Weyl Sequence and another using the Weyl Sequence with a Counter - both were by Bernard Widynski.   


Testing them was interesting as there appeared to be barely a difference between the two new iterations, however, both were much more stable than the original work by von Neuman. Typically with the newer algorithms I'd gather a standard deviation roaming around 4-8 x 10\^15-18. Obviously that's fairly in line with modern standards. The original method had a lower deviation, however, I found that one harder to test perhaps because I should have a used a different algorithm.  


Full documentation can be found here if anyone is interested. For GitHub, it is under KNOWNALGO/W03.

Any word on improvements \[don't get me with ""four space only""\] would be appreciated. Although, I'm fairly certain I could have done much better with the original method probably implementing the ""bit-shift"" way of doing it Bernard used at the very least.  


Might as well link it here, here are the two papers:

buildozer method I followed:  [Creating an AAB for python apps using Buildozer (github.com)](https://gist.github.com/Guhan-SenSam/35c5ed7da254a7c0141e6a8b6101eb33)

play store listing:  [Prime Factorizer Game - Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jf.primefactorizer)

This is my first app, which I wrote in Python and the 'kv' language, using Kivy, compiled to create an android app bundle using buildozer, and successfully uploaded to the Google Play Store.

There is a reasonable amount of support for Kivy but not too much for using it with firebase, so I hope this helps some people trying to make something similar. My github link includes my buildozer spec file and a text file of my firebase rules.

The premise of my game is simple: you're shown a target number, and you need to use the on-screen buttons to input the prime factors of that number, in order of smallest to largest (e.g. for target number 66, the prime factors are 2, 3, and 11, so you would press '2 3 1 1'. You are timed, and each time you complete a target, you get a new one. Target numbers get larger with time so that there is some difficulty progression.

Most of the functionality is shown in the linked video above, but some notable things are that you can create an online profile or play fully offline, the game shows you a variety of stats and graphs of your past play data, there are search functions to find points shown on the graphs, there is an online scoreboard, with a graph showing the leaderboard entries overlapped. You can also view the stats and graphs of other online players.

There are two glitches that I ran into with Kivy:

* kivy-garden scatterplot graphs sometimes have a graphical issue where the data points disappear and are not redrawn. The workaround was to redraw the graph with a slightly different size (I added a numpy random number times a negligibly small number to the size I actually needed).
* in the kivy textboxes, if the user types an '@' sign while the font size is large, it can crash the app. Definitely one of the most bizarre glitches I've ever encountered, but I just kept the font size small to avoid it.

I tried to add sounds for button feedback, but there was too much of a delay and it wasn't very good, so I've taken it out and plan to add sounds sometime in the future with another method to avoid the delay.",1650222127.0
reddit,Python,Use python to optimize the rebar lost in construction.,"Hello everyone, I'm a python beginner. I want to improve my coding skill so I try to use python to help my work.The following problem is bar cut list. It use in construction business. The rebar length is 10 meter each and We have to cut to length follow the order.We have to find the sequence of each Rebar Mark.I.E. We should cut bar No. 439(7350mm) then use it's scrap as rebar No.410 (2650mm) or We might cut bar no.443(6950mm) then no.410(2650mm) this would left the scrap 400mm.The less scrap on rebar the less rebar We have to order.The goal is to minimize rebar scrap on bar cut list.How should I create a logic follow this Idea?I have attached the link to csv file in case you want to try it.Thanks in advance.

reddit,Python,Toolchain recommendations for a production-quality monorepo?,"Hi,

I’m not exactly a newcomer to Python, but I’ve been using C++ pretty much exclusively for all of my professional projects. I am starting a new project in Python where we are going to be using a monorepo and I am looking for some recommendations on what people use for tooling.

Build system: I would like something to help orchestrate tests, generate coverage reports, handle running a typechecker in CI, do dependency analysis to figure out what changed in a commit, build Docker images and package cloud functions. It looks like the leading candidates are Bazel and Pants? Which does the community prefer?

Typechecker: Which do people use? A balance of speed, thoroughness of warnings and integration into editors/build systems seems like the driving factors here.

Dependency management: I am familiar with virtual environments, but to me this seems at odds with a monorepo where the virtual environment will grow boundlessly. Is there any tooling to help here?

Documentation: one of the main points of a monorepo is to ease the reuse of code, so docs are important. I am familiar enough with sphinx to know it is a pain in the butt. Are there any easy-to-use alternatives that can produce comparable quality?

Any other tools that make a big difference in refactoring and shifting errors to the left?

reddit,Python,Arrowdantic 0.1.0 released,"Hi,

I am announcing the release of [arrowdantic](https://pypi.org/project/arrowdantic/):

Arrowdantic is a small Python library backed by a
[mature Rust implementation](https://github.com/jorgecarleitao/arrow2) of Apache Arrow that can interoperate with
* [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/)
* [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) and 
* [ODBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Database_Connectivity) (databases).

It has a similar performance and higher safety (e.g. no segfaults) than pyarrow.

It supports reading from and writing to ODBC compliant databases at
likely similar performance as [`turbodbc`](https://turbodbc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and it does not require conda to install.

This package is particularly suitable for environments such as AWS Lambda - it takes 13M of disk space, compared to 82M taken by pyarrow.

## Features

* declare and access Arrow-backed arrays (integers, floats, boolean, string, binary)
* read from and write to Apache Arrow IPC file
* read from and write to Apache Parquet
* read from and write to ODBC-compliant databases (e.g. postgres, mongoDB)

It is not intended for OLAP type of queries (Pandas, Polars and many others serve this purpose better).

There is still work to support more types (e.g. datetimes, python dictionaries), etc, but the gist is there - a small utility to lower the barrier to interoperate the Arrow format with Parquet, Arrow and ODBC.

Looking forward for feedback!",1650148309.0

reddit,Python,Space Science: Asteroid spectra meet Autoencoders,"Hey Pythonistas,

In my [previous videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNvIBWkEdZ2gagAcgm44cplgSvQ_Cmvbv) I explained and showed the ""nature"" of asteroid spectra. Based on their major 4 classes, I created a Support-Vector-Machine classifier as well as a Keras-based neural network to distinguish between these classes ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/Astroniz-YT-Tutorials/tree/main/%5BML1%5D-Asteroid-Spectra); yes... I should have numbered my scripts starting at 01, 02, 03, ...).

Classifying imbalanced data is really interesting, and it is also somehow exciting to write Conv1D networks, since it is rarely seen (most use Conv2D in their tutorials, since most use images to classify data).

But what would be more interesting than writing a neural network classifier? Well, data classes can be artificial constructs. Especially ""space spectra"" (asteroid, mass spectra of dust particles in space, or spectra of so-called active galactic nuclei), are not always 100% distinguishable and have transitional classes between major classes.

So... can we classify our asteroid spectra in a data-driven way? Well, that's the goal of my last 3 video sessions, starting today with the very first one. The idea:

\- Creating an Autoencoder to reconstruct asteroid spectra

\- Displaying and inspecting the latent space of these spectra

\- Applying some clustering algorithm on the latent space to determine a data science based number of potential asteroid classes

Starting with the Autoencoder part I'd like to share my most recent tutorial:

reddit,Python,Shipping command line programs with a python package,"I already know this inherently sounds like a bad idea, but I'd love some genuine, constructive technical advice on the following scenario.

I have a python package that is used by others at work, and one of the features I need to add is the ability to upload binary files (\~1GB) from local to a cloud object storage, in this case Azure Data Lake.

The Azure Data Lake python client does have the ability to upload data, but it is significantly slower than their recommended command line bulk copy tool AzCopy.

**Can I get feedback on this approach:**

\-pip install the python package

\-the python package already has a command line entry point so the user would type something like

    &lt;package_name&gt; setup externals

Which would then run a setup script which would install azcopy to the users $HOME path and create a symlink to their PATH for the binary to run.

\-Then python would use it via subprocess.

**For me the negatives I see are:**

\-Having to write handling code for the setup script to fail gracefully.

\-Possibly having to host the already installed binaries on a fileshare somewhere so URL changes and version changes don't break the installer

\-Having an extra step if someone else clones the repo, pip installs the requirements, they have one more step before they can recreate.

**Positives are:**

\-AzCopy is way faster than the python sdk and doesn't have to upload objects one at a time.

\-I can extend this to use RClone eventually to make it cloud storage agnostic, and have it work with S3 as well

reddit,Python,Recover deleted and overwritten files with RecoverPy 1.5.0,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/qg7rwesb1vt81.gif

Hi! I recently release RecoverPy v1.5.0 and I think I might give you some news.

**-&gt; Repo:** [https://github.com/PabloLec/RecoverPy](https://github.com/PabloLec/RecoverPy)  


# What is it?

RecoverPy is a 100% Python tool to not only recover deleted but also overwritten files.  
I got the idea when I was quite new to some programming best practices, especially version control...  


Long story short, I accidentally piped my output into my precious script... Just spent the day working on something and instead of typing myscript &gt; log, I typed log &gt; myscript, oh boy what a feeling.

I knew some tools to recover deleted files, but my problem was quite different, I didn't deleted the file (in system words, marked the file blocks as deleted/available), I just replaced it's content. Talk about an impostor syndrome.

After a long ride in the abysses of unix stackexchange, I found some dark combination of grep and dd command to search directly in your raw system partitions blocks and eventually recovered my file! But as the process was really slow and painful, I thought it might be a good idea to make a tool out of it. That's how RecoverPy was born.  


# 1.5.0

Since then, the tool has had quite some success. Especially in the hacker community (wasn't the initial intent but still). It even appeared in hakin9 magazine.

Last releases have been quite stable, lastly I mostly added QoL updates and better binary file search handling.

Feel free to have a look and tell me what you think of it! It's my biggest personal project and I'm beginning to be quite proud of my baby :)",1650101676.0

reddit,Python,TL;DR: Dictionary Comprehension + Early\Late Binding of Lambdas in Python is Mental,"Hello,

I found a behaviour I couldn't explain when using lambdas in a dictionary comprehension so I decided to post a little Intermediate Showcase to inform you about my struggles and give you a solution, in the end (no spoilers)

I like to minify python code in my spare time to relax and it often takes some iterations for each different function or class, alongside those iterations I was golfing a function in a progress bar script I wrote a very long time ago, this is the brief description of what the function should have done: `The function has to take a list of n elements and color them green, yellow or red according to a given condition.`

This was the last *functioning* function in the process of being golfed:

    def paint(total, done, elements):
        
        color_str  = lambda x, y: f'{x}{y}\033[00m'
    
        colors = {'r'   : lambda x: color_str('\033[91m',x),
                  'g' : lambda x: color_str('\033[92m',x),
                  'y': lambda x: color_str('\033[93m',x)
                  }['g' if total == done else 'y' if total/2 &lt;= done else 'r']
    
        return [*map(colors,elements)]

I thought, that's easy, this has to be equivalent to this golfed function:

    def paint(total, done, elements):
        return [*map({'rgy'[i]:lambda x:f'\033[9{i+1}m{x}\033[00m' for i in range(len('rgy'))
               }['g' if total == done else 'y' if done &lt;= total/2 else 'r'],elements)]

*Until it's not*, in fact, while the first function outputs a correct response, the last one is **somehow** stuck on the color yellow, so I thought the dictionary comprehension wasn't working properly and thus I tried:

    dict_comp = {'rgy'[i]:lambda x:f'\033[9{i+1}m{x}\033[00m' for i in range(len('rgy'))}
    print(dict_comp)

This prompted what I thought it would prompt, a dictionary with `r`,`g` and `y` as keys and a list of lambdas in different memory locations `{'r': &lt;function &lt;dictcomp&gt;.&lt;lambda&gt; at 0x0000018D3E986200&gt;, 'g': &lt;function &lt;dictcomp&gt;.&lt;lambda&gt; at 0x0000018D3E9860E0&gt;, 'y': &lt;function &lt;dictcomp&gt;.&lt;lambda&gt; at 0x0000018D3E986050&gt;}` so I tried to print all the key and lambda pairs with a test for each lambda:

    for key, lmbd in dict_comp.items():
        print(key, lmbd(f'Testing {key}'))

This was the output:

I decided to remove the slash to check the text value of the lambda and the correct progression of `i` and this why I noticed the problem: each lambda stored the last value of `i`!

    dict_comp = {'rgy'[i]:lambda x:f'033[9{i+1}m{x}\033[00m' for i in range(len('rgy'))}
    for key, lmbd in dict_comp.items():
        print(key, lmbd(f'Testing {key}'))
    
    &gt;&gt; r 033[93mTesting r # the value after the square bracket is 93 (it's supposed to be 91)
    &gt;&gt; g 033[93mTesting g # the value after the square bracket is 93 (it's supposed to be 92)
    &gt;&gt; y 033[93mTesting y # the value after the square bracket is 93

Here's the whole code in order to try both functions:

    from time import sleep
    
    def paint(total, done, elements):
        
        color_str  = lambda x, y: f'{x}{y}\033[00m'
    
        colors     =   {'r'   : lambda x: color_str('\033[91m',x),
                        'g' : lambda x: color_str('\033[92m',x),
                        'y': lambda x: color_str('\033[93m',x)
                        }['g' if total == done else 'y' if total/2 &lt;= done else 'r']
    
        return [*map(colors,elements)]
    
    
    # UNCOMMENT THIS IN ORDER TO TEST THE FUNCTION DOWN BELOW
    """"""
    def paint(total, done, elements):
        return [*map({'rgy'[i]:lambda x:f'\033[9{i+1}m{x}\033[00m' for i in range(len('rgy'))
               }['g' if total == done else 'y' if done &lt;= total/2 else 'r'],elements)]
    """"""
    
    def CustomProgressBar(task, completeness) -&gt; None:
        size = 100 // 5
        empty  = size - completeness//5
        fill = size - empty
        
        percent  = f'{completeness:&gt;3}% '
        
        filler = f'{""═""*fill}'
        isComplete = fill==size
    
        progress_bar, percent  = paint(size,fill, [filler, percent])
        progress_bar+=f'{""─""*empty}'
    
        print(f'\r{task:&lt;25}{percent}{progress_bar}',
                end='\n' if isComplete else '')
    
    
    
    for i in range(101):
        sleep(0.05)
        CustomProgressBar('Range 0-100', i)

I then asked myself:

&gt;Why does this happen? Isn't each anonymous function different?

After some scavenger hunt in StackOverFlow (thanks you Stack for the duplicate question tootip) I found out that the issue might be in [late binding in functions and lambdas in particular](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3431676/creating-functions-in-a-loop), so the answer, apparently, is that even if the functions are stored in a different memory location as part of the dictionary, the lambda function captures the ***NAME*** of the variable, not the ***VALUE*** of the variable and assigns the value after the dict comprehension is called, so each value becomes the last value in the loop, as the friendliest guy on StackOverFlow explains [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70862614/how-does-python-dict-comprehension-work-with-lambda-functions-inside).

And so, the solution was there, after several hours of head scratches and articles about early and late bind  and (anonymous) functions in loop variables inside loops, I had to tie (or late-bind, if you will) the value name of the variable in the lambda function to the  value of the variable in the loop.

This means I had to create another value in the lambda and that the value HAS to be the last in the lambda function because it will be created as a keyword argument and lambdas respect the rule of \*args first, \*\*kwargs last.

So, the solution was finally here:

    def paint(total, done, elements):
        return [*map({'rgy'[i]:lambda x, y=i+1:f'\033[9{y}m{x}\033[00m'for i in range(len('rgy'))}['g' if total == done else 'y' if done &gt;= total/2 else 'r'],elements)]

If you have any question, you find this interesting, you have any feedback, you want to talk about Python or you just want to send me death threats because I wrote a long-ass post about lambdas and how they work in loops, HMU or comment down below.

reddit,Python,Good GUI builder for Python similar to Java’s Eclipse Windowbuilder,"Hi guys! I’m a Java developer migrating to Python, and I’m trying to find a good GUI builder that is similar to Java’s Eclipse windowbuilder. I have tried PyQy5 and it’s Qt Designer which is very good and very close to windowbuilder in terms of interface, but the only problem is that the Qt Designer doesn’t work dynamically with the IDE like the windowbuilder: all Qt Designer’s ui file need to be translated manually to py file and then modified. This is really bad for efficiency since everything added and modified in the Qt Designer need to be saved and translated again and manually copied from the new py file to the main py file, and all objects’ code’s locations need to be manually located (Unlike in windowbuider where you double click the object in the builder and you will be automatically redirected to the related code) 
Since Python is such a popular language and so many people use it to develop complicated GUI softwares, I guess there has to be a GUI builder that is more efficient and similar to Java’s windowbuilder",1649999500.0

reddit,Python,Collection(s) of counter-intuitive Python behaviour,"This is kind of a shot in the blue: Some time ago I found a  (GitHub?) repo that collected unexpected/surprising Python behaviour. Ofc this depends on ones knowledge but it is stuff that is counter-intuitive if you don't know it or the internals.

The first example was [internal caching of -5...256](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/18leav/python_integer_range_5_256_and_identity_comparison/) and all the consequences of that (ids, is), …

If you don't know that particular repo, do you know similar behaviour? I found this [Python oddities talk](https://treyhunner.com/python-oddities/) but that wasn't it.

Secondary question: What would be a good source for this (edit: finding oddities/inconsistencies)? I enjoyed to learn what's new by reading the release notes &lt;3. I found looking/searching through [bugs.python.org](https://bugs.python.org/) quite interesting, because you can follow a discussion about aspectes of the language properties/behaviour, same idea why I skimmed PEPs and their discussion.

However, there is always something one does not know and I want to learn all of that. For that reason I am keeping a file in which I document parts of the language that I am not that used to, and then I mostly play around with `ptpython` and try stuff which I try to use later on if it seems like a good fit.

I guess well fitting flairs are discussion, help, resource, … but since I can't really decide I am choosing help. after all I want help to find a resource which could provide material for a discussion.",1649981969.0

reddit,Python,Ready-Made Mobile App UI for Serverless Python,"I made a tool for myself to wrap Python code in a mobile app (chat interface) so that I can let my non-technical friends try any programs I write. Curious if you guys would be interested too. 

I like coding in Python, but I didn't like how my non-technical friends and family couldn't try my python apps. So I made a lightweight frontend for iOS and Android using Flutter and a lightweight web app to fill in a serverless Python function. 

This is how it works:

1. User uses the mobile app to send a message. Optionally with an attachment, like an image. This message is sent to serverless function as a JSON object. 
2. Serverless function starter code is just print(msg) and return empty\_message. But when I want to write an app, I do some operations on msg, and return a JSON in a certain schema. 
3. Mobile app gets the JSON back from serverless, and I render it to user according to the JSON schema. 

I thought I'd try a bunch of consumer app ideas, but I actually ended up mostly making a bunch of other tools for myself. Like when I send a hard-coded message like ""redis flushall"", I make the backend flush redis cache for another app that I made. 

I'm not really utilizing my own tool well, so I'm curious whether anyone here would be interested in using it to make some consumer tools. I can't publicly open it, cuz I made it for myself and there's no robust authentication to prevent people from running spam code on the serverless infra. But I'd love to send link and placeholder auth to some people if you are interested and leave a comment! (Would love to know what kind of apps you'd build!). 

If a lot of people are interested, I'll work on protecting it behind some auth, or let people pay for their own compute cost (for example, log in to their AWS; and automatically set up a VM to run the python code you write using my web IDE)!",1649972674.0

reddit,Python,Financial portfolio optimization for scikit-learn enthusiasts,"Scikit-portfolio is a Python package designed to introduce **data scientists and machine learning engineers** to the problem of **optimal portfolio allocation in finance**. The main idea of scikit-portfolio is to provide many well-known portfolio optimization methods with an easily accessible **scikit-learn inspired** set of API.

You can optimize your portfolio starting from a pandas Dataframe with the prices or returns and simply compute the MinVol vanilla portfolio to get the optimal weights as:

`MinimumVolatility().fit(prices).weights_`

When your portfolio optimization method depends on a number of hyperparameters you can simply perform a `GridSearchCV` as in machine-learning algorithms, and present the grid of hyperparameters, which for most methods are already encoded in the class.

```
prices_train, prices_test = train_test_split(prices, test_size=0.3, shuffle=False)
ptf_model = MaxSharpe()
best_model = GridSearchCV(
    estimator=ptf_model,
    param_grid=ptf_model.grid_parameters(),
    cv=KFold(5),
    scoring=sharpe_ratio_scorer
).fit(prices_train)
```

It implements Omega Ratio and MAD efficient frontier as well as a number of portfolio hyperparameters search methods for the optimization in backtesting settings, using the same methods as in classical machine-learning model selection method.

Additionally, I've implemented ensemble portfolios, like the **Michaud Resampled Efficient Frontier** that builds an optimal portfolio based on the average of many efficient frontiers based on random perturbations of the expected returns.
We not only support the classical MeanVariance efficient frontier, but many kind of efficient frontiers, with different definitions of risk and satisfaction.

This is for example how you build an ensemble of estimators of the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio:
```
prices = load_tech_stock_prices()
# create a Maximum sharpe ratio portfolio estimator to be fed to resampled frontier meta-estimator
ptf = MaxSharpe(
    returns_data=False,
    risk_free_rate=0.0,
    frequency=252,
    rets_estimator=MeanHistoricalLinearReturns()
)
ensemble = MichaudResampledFrontier(
    ptf_estimator=ptf,
    rets_estimator=MeanHistoricalLinearReturns(), 
    risk_estimator=SampleCovariance(),
    n_iter=512,
    n_jobs=-1
).fit(prices)
```

The project requires some help in the documentation, while it is already pretty stable in the API and bugfix.

reddit,Python,Parts of the Standard Library that are considered to be bad practice / un-Pythonic ?,"I had an argument today about the using the `_empty` object from the `inspect` module to denote an item not found in a lookup, rather than just returning None (as None could well be a value in our data), or erroring (as too many try/excepts make code more difficult to read, and failing to find something in our system is not actually an error anyway). 

Aside from the idea of using a private attribute of another module, the other person says it's ""not Pythonic"" to use smaller custom types like this, as it's too close to something like `typedef` in c++ (never mind that Python has `namedtuple` for almost the exact same purpose anyway, but I digress).

I argued that it's a ready-made and easily legible solution to the problem, and regardless, if it's good enough for the standard library then it should be good enough for us. 

While I think I'm right in this case, I know the last point is a very dogmatic way of looking at things.

It got me thinking - are there any notable parts of the language's standard modules, that would be considered a poor or incorrect use of the language if you were to use them in production?",1649964161.0

reddit,Python,The fastest tool for querying large JSON files is written in Python! (benchmark),"[spyql](https://github.com/dcmoura/spyql) is a tool (and python lib) for querying and transforming data. It is fully written in Python.

In the [latest benchmark](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dcmoura/spyql/blob/master/notebooks/json_benchmark.ipynb), spyql outperformed all other tools, including jq, one of the most popular tools written in C.

Here is one example extracted from the benchmark that shows spyql achieving the lowest processing time while keeping memory requirements low when the dataset size is &gt;= 100MB.

&amp;#x200B;

[Processing time and memory requirements vs size of input JSON data](https://preview.redd.it/ejgy2k0gwbt81.png?width=1315&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=782958571e0a5a7309484011fbc0d7c1c9da5015)

IMO, these results might questions some preconceived opinions about Python’s performance and interpreted languages in general.

The benchmark is very easy to reproduce without installing any software since it runs on a [google colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dcmoura/spyql/blob/master/notebooks/json_benchmark.ipynb).

Happy to hear your thoughts!

**UPDATE 2022/04/22**

Thank you all for your feedback. The benchmark was updated and the fastest tool is **NOT** written in Python. Here are the highlights:

* Added ClickHouse (written in C++) to the benchmark: I was unaware that the clickhouse-local tool would handle these tasks. ClickHouse is now the fastest (together with OctoSQL);
* OctoSQL (written in Go) was updated as a response to the benchmark: updates included switching to fastjson, short-circuiting LIMIT, and eagerly printing when outputting JSON and CSV. Now, OctoSQL is one of the fastest and memory is stable;
* SPyQL (written in Python) is now third: SPyQL leverages orjson (Rust) to parse JSONs, while the query engine is written in Python. When processing 1GB of input data, SPyQL takes 4x-5x more time than the best, while still achieving up to 2x higher performance than jq (written in C);
* I removed Pandas from the benchmark and focused on command-line tools. I am planning a separate benchmark on Python libs where Pandas, Polars and Modin (and eventually others) will be included.

This benchmark is a living document. If you are interested in receiving updates, please subscribe to the following issue: [https://github.com/dcmoura/spyql/issues/72](https://github.com/dcmoura/spyql/issues/72)

reddit,Python,Ohio State University Researchers Develop SAT2LoD2: An Open-Source Python Tool For 3D Landscape Modelling Using Satelite Imagery,"3D landscape modeling has seen a rise in its popularity and applications in recent years. It has countless applications in the fields of civil engineering, earth sciences, military applications, and many others. Geometric 3D models are typically developed using the city geography markup language (CityGML), and the Level-of-Detail (LoD) building model is the preferred model for building 3D models using CityGML. 

The use of Satellite imagery for landscape modeling provides the advantage of covering a wide area and is low cost. However, developing LoD2 models using satellite imagery remains a big challenge. Building models in such a way involves complex steps demanding heuristics-based approaches and ML-based detection paradigms.

In a recent paper, researchers at the Ohio State University propose a [SAT2LoD2 ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.04139v1.pdf)to facilitate the development of 3D landscape models. SAT2LoD2 is an open-source, python-based GUI-enabled software that takes the satellite images as inputs and returns LoD2 building models as outputs. The software also has the feature of taking road networks and custom maps as additional inputs for better results.

reddit,Python,A python framework for unstructured data processing,"Unstructured data is information that is not arranged according to a predefined schema or data model. Image, text, video, and nested JSON are the most common types of unstructured data we collected in real-world applications.

We have just released [Towhee 0.6](https://github.com/towhee-io/towhee), a framework for doing ML jobs over unstructured data. Our latest release includes [`DataCollection`](https://towhee.readthedocs.io/en/branch0.6/data_collection/get_started.html), a new user-centric method-chaining API that enables rapid development and prototyping of unstructured data applications.

`DataCollection` is designed to behave as a python list or generator, with some enhancement features such as `method-chaining coding style`, `parallel execution`, and `exception handling`. Here is a short example of image animation:

```python
import towhee

towhee.glob['path']('./test.png') \
      .image_decode['path', 'origin']() \
      .img2img_translation.animegan['origin', 'facepaintv2'](model_name = 'facepaintv2') \
      .img2img_translation.animegan['origin', 'hayao'](model_name = 'hayao') \
      .img2img_translation.animegan['origin', 'paprika'](model_name = 'paprika') \
      .img2img_translation.animegan['origin', 'shinkai'](model_name = 'shinkai') \
      .select['origin', 'facepaintv2', 'hayao', 'paprika', 'shinkai']() \
      .show()
```

[`image_decode`](https://towhee.io/image-decode/cv2) and [`img2img_translation.animegan`](https://towhee.io/img2img-translation/animegan) are predefined `operator`s from [towhee hub](https://towhee.io). We already have nearly a hundred operators, officially maintained or contributed by our users.

You can check the result from [the tutorial](https://github.com/towhee-io/towhee/blob/main/tutorials/anime_style_transformer.ipynb). 

Documentation for DataCollection is available [here](https://towhee.readthedocs.io/en/branch0.6/data_collection/get_started.html). We will be releasing code examples and tutorials using the new API in the upcoming weeks.

reddit,Python,Do people generally write Sphinx API documentation using autoapi or manually?,"(this might not be the best subreddit, but I didn't see a Sphinx subreddit, if there's a better place, let me know)

I'm working on writing my first distributable python package and I'm trying to be very meticulous about the documentation, making a readthedocs page for it. I'm very new to using Sphinx, and I'm confused on the landscape of projects that have autogenerated API documentation vs. those that involve manually written documentation. 


I have been able to get the `autoapi` extension to work, but the documentation it generates feels very boilerplate, and I want to go in and reformat some of the stuff it does, which I think it's possible to essentially ""convert"" a project from auto to manual. So maybe I should autogenerate it at first and then convert it for later changes. I have some concerns about that approach though.


1. What if I add more stuff to the API later, or update the way certain functions work? Would I just need to do those small changes by hand? I feel like if I reverted to the autogeneration it would overwrite my manual changes (maybe I'm wrong though).

2. I actually prefer to code at the same time that I am documenting, so that the documentation is not an afterthought, but in that case I would want to do the manual changes at the same time as when I code, so maybe autogeneration is a bad idea for me. But this particular project is collaborative and I think I'm probably the only one in my group who *enjoys* the documentation, so I want to be sure it's super easy for future collaborators.

Besides the clean and simple interface is the highly-efficient raw sockets manipulation library implemented in the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) language with [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs/) wrapper.

Pinging is simple:

Send one echo request and await for reply:

    ping = Ping()
    rtt = await ping.ping(""127.0.0.1"")

Send a series of requests and await replies:

    ping = Ping()
    async for rtt in ping.iter_rtt(""127.0.0.1"", count=5):
        print(rtt)

Gufo Ping is fast, allowing to monitor 100 000+ hosts at once.

reddit,Python,Porting from Windows to Linux: Python vs. Powershell?,"From a search, it looks like this question comes up every couple of months and, like everything else in IT, the answer is ""It depends."" So, here are my depends...

TL;DR - My shop is running database servers on Windows with maintenance and health check scripts written in DOS .BAT files. The company plans to migrate to cloud servers running Linux using the same database software (DB2 LUW). I want to update our scripts to a new scripting language prior to migrating and port to the new platforms when the time comes. In terms of porting between platforms, and getting a team of DBAs used to a new scripting language, would you go with Python or Powershell? Python seems easier to learn and implement, but I think PS might port better. Your thoughts?

---

My shop is running database servers on Windows (not SQL Server) with the intent to migrate to cloud servers running Linux at some point in the future yet to be determined. Our database maintenance scripts are DOS .BAT files. That alone is reason enough to rewrite in a better language and, while we're at, we'll build in intelligence, restartability, health checks, logging. Not a lot of activity from the scripts themselves as they mostly run utilities and not many will run in a day or at once.

My plan is to convert the DOS .BAT files to PS now and port to Linux when/if we migrate.  However, I'm seeing a lot about Python and looked over some code. The pros I see for it is it seems easy to pick up and not too fussy. I also see comments on its speed and low resource consumption. Those same comments also note that speed and resources aren't an issue as long as concurrency is low, as it is in my case.

How is Python in porting between OSes? In Powershell, you have to code path names using the .net objects in order to get OS-independent code. Is there a similar mechanism in Python or will things like drive names and path separator characters cause issues?

Another example in PS is 'sort'.  If you use the 'sort' command, it will invoke the command for that OS which may behave differently. To get OS-independence, you have to use the actual Powershell command Sort-Object.

Are there similar work-arounds in Python for path names? Does Python have issues with system commands that are named the same in both OSes? Are there any other porting gotchas?

EDIT to answer common questions: The DB software is DB2 from IBM. There's a mainframe version, which we run on z/OS, and an LUW version, where LUW stands for Linux/Unix/Windows. Although it runs on Windows, industry standard for DB2 LUW is to run on Linux or AIX. We're currently running DB2 LUW on Windows Servers. Job scheduling is handled on the mainframe with remote triggers to the servers to run the scripts. The scripts are running utilities like reorgs, backups, restoring backups to other servers and then sending completion or failed status back to the mainframe scheduler.",1649730644.0

This morning I started working on the 'two heaps' algorithms. It struck me as a bit odd that python or the writers of the heapq library decided to make all implementations of heap minheaps rather than adding some additional APIs for maxheaps. 

Maybe it's just me, but I find it a bit hard to reason through programs that make use of maxheaps. Having to remember to push a value multiplied by -1 and then do the same for retrieval feels a bit un-intuitive, but maybe it's just me. 

Does anyone know of the reasoning behind not implementing them separately and adding a thin layer to the maxheaps to avoid having to do this? I'm mostly just curious if there was any discussion around it when heapq was created but haven't been able to find anything yet.",1649684785.0

app.config.from\_object(config object)

Now I need to access urls defined in the config class in other places. I tried accessing these configs using the current app proxy. But I realised that I also have to access these class outside the request/ app context as I have celery tasks which access them.

One approach is to pass this config as a variable to every class it is required, which I dont prefer. Another option is to annotate the config class as singleton and create the config object at every place where I need them.  I also came across this library called Dependency\_Injector. [https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/](https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/) This seems a bit heavy weight for my use case though.

I keep up my weekly tutorial sessions (some asked, whether I could increase it to 2 videos or more per week... But I have too many things to do... let's see how it continues in the long run!).

Anyway, what did we do in the last couple of weeks? Using Python on Google Colab we:

- Downloaded asteroid spectra + their corresponding class (whether it is e.g. a stony or iron obejct)
- Parsed, cleaned and enriched the data
- Created an interactive spectrum visualization tool in Colab
- Conducted a Machine Learning experiment using scikit-learn and their SVM implementation
- Created a neural network with Keras and optimized its architecture with Keras-Tuner to classify our data

So are we done?

Theoretically yes. But I would like to conclude the asteroid part with an unsupervised ML algorithm: Autoencoders! Using this neural network architecture + some clustering algorithms I'd like to show how one can create an unsupervised classification method.

But what are Autoencoders exactly, and how do they work?

Well to split up theory and coding a little bit, I created a small ""concept"" video on Autoencoders, so that we can start coding next time (knowing what we want to do and what to expect).

I am not a CGI expert or big YouTuber. It's more ""seminar-like"" and I'd like to know your opinion on this, whether it's useful, or not.

Link: https://youtu.be/ET441nffKjU

So what will we do next with Python, Keras and the asteroid data?

- Next tutorial: creating an Autoencoder using Keras (we won't use Keras-Tuner, to keep things simple). We'll also check the ""reconstruction"" power of the Autoencoder that compresses the 49-dimensional spectra into 2 dimensions

- Afterwards: how does the latent space look like? We'll create an interactive Jupyter Viewer to visualise the latent space and color the spectrum class corresponding latent values to determine whether we have a ""class separation"" or not

- Last video of the entire project: Rebuild an Autoencoder with a larger latent space, and applying Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to determine the number of possible classes using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)

Well... Afterwards a new Space + Python project will start :)

Hope you guys like it. I am looking forward to suggestions and ideas!

See you next week!

It brings the runtime information tracking and optimization to a new level without compromising with speed and system performance, or hiding any tracking overhead information. HiQ applies for both I/O bound and CPU bound applications.

To explain the four features, declarative means you can declare the things you want to track in a text file, which could be a JSON, YAML or even CSV, and no need to change program code. Non-intrusive means HiQ doesn’t requires to modify original python code. Dynamic means HiQ supports tracing metrics featuring at run time, which can be used for adaptive tracing. Transparent means HiQ provides the tracing overhead and doesn’t hide it no matter it is huge or tiny.

In addition to latency tracking, HiQ provides memory, disk I/O and Network I/O tracking out of the box. The output can be saved in form of normal line by line log file, or HiQ tree, or span graph.

I hope that it might lower the barrier of entry for teachers with some python knowledge to get started with using programming to ease the repetitive aspects of our work.

Comments, criticism, and code review are much appreciated!

reddit,Python,Using Github to host local images permenently on the web.,"When you create an issue or add an image on github, you can actually upload images to the github server without any external apis. We can use this feature to mimic Github's behavior when uploading an image and upload any local image to the web. Because github has to store all images permenently (or images on READMEs or issues could change), we also do not have to worry about uploaded images expiring.

I have been using this feature (although not automatically) for a long time to host images for my own website, and finally managed to automate this process.

Honestly, as a beginner in programming, hosting images for websites for free is a pain in the ass and I hope this will help people learn more about websites.

reddit,Python,"Does clean code equal ""Workplace"" code","I am a beginner at python and have been following Angela Yu's 100 days of python. I commented on a post regarding my Coffee Machine code been some 400 lines while hers was around 150 lines with the same functionilty.

&amp;#x200B;

This led me to ask this question of, if code works does it matter if it's clean and pythonic.

&amp;#x200B;

I will reference these two tic toe games below:

&amp;#x200B;

18000 lines (no adherence to DRY but simple to understand)

[https://github.com/asweigart/my\_first\_tic\_tac\_toe/blob/9f38b04e857426c5a5b80919ad0b5fce0947c022/tictactoe.py](https://github.com/asweigart/my_first_tic_tac_toe/blob/9f38b04e857426c5a5b80919ad0b5fce0947c022/tictactoe.py)

&amp;#x200B;

1 line (I was shocked that such a thing was even possible, considering my tic tac toe code was around 500 lines with no AI. This code is in my opinion way way to complex and one would probably be working in the realm of datasciences/ML to understand such a thing)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9ozfeq/tictactoe\_in\_one\_line\_python35/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9ozfeq/tictactoe_in_one_line_python35/)

&amp;#x200B;

Both programs work, but if one was given only the option of picking from the two, which would be preffered in the workplace? In my opinion, the 18000 line code would be acceptable as it allows all team members, novice or not to atleast have some understanding.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Better late than never, but I realised I have been referencing my tic tac toe code of 500 lines vs the 1 and 18000 liners but havent posted it for comparison.

So here it is (I do acknowledge that a tic tac toe game has no relevance to the workplace, but is the code structure I used somewhere along the lines of ""hirable"".):

It shows the importance of documentation in an Open source project and how frustrating it can be if it’s not a priority. Some important things, in my opinion:

1. When you encounter documentation problems, help a maintainer and open a change request to improve them.
2. Licenses are by far the most important type of documentation for users and contributors.
3. Documentation helps build engaged communities.
4. When communicating about a project, use language that is clear and accessible to people who are not born English or do not read English fluently.

Broadly, it parses your `extras_require` dict from your `requirements.txt` file using special comments rather than having to define the same thing twice.

As noted in the documentation, there are situations where you wouldn't want to use this, most commonly for libraries. requirements.txt and package dependencies have different purposes in that case: requirements.txt provides a full, (somewhat) reproducible environment for CI and other developers to get an environment with hard versions and all of your linters etc., where package dependencies provide a minimal, permissive environment to allow as many people to use your library as possible. extreqs is primarily designed for applications (web backends, CLIs etc) which have optional extra functionality.

reddit,Python,"Configpile: a modern, typed argparse replacement","I started documenting astronomy code written by a PhD student, and wanted a command-line parsing library that would be self documenting.

Thus [ConfigPile](https://denisrosset.github.io/configpile/) was born! It's based on dataclasses with annotated types.

Sample code (imports omitted):

    @dataclass(frozen=True)
    class Calc(Config):
        """"""
        A simple calculator
        """"""

        #: First number to add
        x: Annotated[float, Param.store(parsers.float_parser, short_flag_name=""-x"")]

        #: Second number to add
        y: Annotated[float, Param.store(parsers.float_parser, short_flag_name=""-y"")]

    c = Calc.from_command_line_()
    print(f""{c.x} + {c.y} = {c.x+c.y}"")

Running this with ""-h"", you can a nice usage help automatically generated (through a legacy ArgumentParser). The same can feed the [sphinx-argparse](https://sphinx-argparse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) extension to include documentation in the project web pages.

Configpile is based on modern Python, is written in mostly functional style, has user-friendly error reporting which accumulates errors instead of bailing out immediately, supports environment variables and INI files.

I'd be super grateful for comments, especially about the documentation and the Python style.

Follow a tutorial here: https://denisrosset.github.io/configpile/tutorial/index.html

Learn about the main concepts here: https://denisrosset.github.io/configpile/concepts/index.html

reddit,Python,Online coding video tutorials - Opinions,"Hello everyone,

I am currently creating some space science + Python [YouTube tutorials](https://youtube.com/c/Astroniz). In these videos I do some coding and provide some explanations on what I am doing, the science behind it etc.

Now I was wondering whether this is a good approach at all. I really like creating some content on YouTube (no I am not a professional one with my few 100 subscribers), and I am eager to improve it steadily. However I thought that ""live coding"" may take too much time and isn't easy to follow. My idea is to explain e.g., science related Jupyter Notebook cells in the videos to shorten the length. The code is provided on GitHub anyway, so a viewer could follow my tutorial (and thoughts) more easily. The coding would be reduced to a minimum and the focus could move to the ""non coding"" part.

Any ideas or comments would be appreciated!

reddit,Python,My first package to pypi. Connpy: Network connection manager and automation module,"Hi!

So a little bit of background, I'm a network engineer (ccie), with 10+ years of experience in networking, and i'm a really lazy guy so usually i try to automate and script everything. long time ago i created my bash connection manager and been using it since. A month ago i decided it was time to upgrade it to python and add the automation function i always wanted, and that is how connpy was born.

I'm not a programmer so it may have some issues! let me know.

[https://github.com/fluzzi/connpy/](https://github.com/fluzzi/connpy/) &lt;- here is the link, it also have some documentation it should be easy to use. It's created for linux as it's what i use everyday but i did some testing on macos and it should work.

## connection manager

First its the connection manager, it adds the commands conn/connpy to shell, and you can add all the devices you manage easily:

- conn --add server1

you can add folders and subfolders to organize your devices. i use to work with a lot of clients so i have like 400+ nodes divided in multiples folders.

- conn --add ""@office""  
- conn --add ""@servers@office""
- conn --add server2@servers@office
- conn --add server3@servers@office
- conn --add router1@office

when you are creating a new node to connect, it allows you to refer profiles, this way you can manage passwords and other information in 1 place and use it in multiple nodes.

- conn profile --add officeuser

then you reference inside the node configuration using ""@officeuser"".  

you can use profiles to send multiple passwords in case you use 1 or more jumphosts.

Once the nodes are created you just connect to them without passwords.
- conn server1
- conn server2@servers@home
- conn server

## automation module

this is the new feature, once you created your nodes you can use them with the automation module

- import connpy
- config = connpy.configfile()
- server1 = config.getitem(""server1@office"")
- router1 = config.getitem(""router@office"")
- server = connpy.node(""server1"",**server1,config = config)
- router = connpy.node(""router1"",**router1,config = config)
- print(router.run([""term len 0"", ""show run""]))
- if server.test(""ls -la"", ""folder to find""):
-   print(""folder found"")
- else:
-   print(""missing folder"")

You can also run in multiple devices at the same time using class nodes. (more in the documentation)

Hope someone find it useful!!

# CaptchaCracker

## Introduction

CaptchaCracker is an open source Python library that provides functions to create and apply deep learning models for Captcha Image recognition. You can create a deep learning model that recognizes numbers in the Captcha Image as shown below and outputs a string of numbers, or you can try the model yourself.

## Input

https://preview.redd.it/qltiatrqxgr81.png?width=250&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e4d370203ff502b4681c8b35a8fee1cff7fd259

## Output

    023062

## Installation

    pip install CaptchaCracker

## Dependency

    pip install numpy==1.19.5 tensorflow==2.5.0

## Examples

## Train and save the model

Before executing model training, training data image files in which the actual value of the Captcha image is indicated in the file name should be prepared as shown below.

## Installation.

QualityScaler is completely portable; just download, unzip and execute the file .exe

## Supported AI Backend.

* Nvidia Cuda \[v10.2\]
* CPU \[works without GPU, but is very slow\]

## Features.

* Easy to use GUI
* Images and video upscale
* Drag&amp;drop files \[image/multiple images/video\]
* Different upscale factors:
   * auto - automatic choose best upscale factor for the GPU used (to avoid running out of VRAM)
   * x1   - will mantain same resolution but will reconstruct the image (ideal for bigger images) 
   * x2   - upscale factor 2: 500x500px -&gt; 1000x1000px
   * x4   - upscale factor 4: 500x500px -&gt; 2000x2000px
* Cpu and Gpu \[cuda\] backend
* Compatible images - PNG, JPEG, BMP, WEBP, TIF  
* Compatible video  - MP4, WEBM, GIF, MKV, FLV, AVI, MOV 

## Next steps.

1. Use both model for the upscale
2. Include audio for upscaled video
3. Support for other GPUs (AMD, Intel) with new backend

You **don't** need to caption the images for the search to work, and it is **not** just limited to objects in the image but an overall understanding built using a neural network trained on images/text found on internet.

This is what [CLIP-as-service](https://github.com/jina-ai/clip-as-service) enables. It is an open-source library to create embeddings of images and text using CLIP. These embeddings can be used to find the relevant images for any sentence.

**What is CLIP?**

CLIP is a Neural Network trained on variety of images and natural language sentences available on the internet. It enables understanding of concepts in an image as natural language. This can be used for cases such as searching image by text or describing an image in natural language.

The demo screenshot shown in the post is an example showing relevant images for a particular query sentence.

As a .NET developer by day, I've always been bummed by the lack of real Swagger spec generators available for Flask compared to Swashbuckle for ASP.NET.  I personally don't want to write some markup or clutter the service with a bunch of code to generate the docs, I wanted something that would generate the spec for you, with no setup required, with optional features to expand the detail of the documentation.

So I built that!  If you like Swagger, you'll like this.  It's a pretty full-featured library, but I'm sure there's room for improvement and welcome any friends that'd like to contribute.

reddit,Python,"Who exactly is a python developer? I know this is a broad term which include many paths. But do we have to cover them all to become one? much like, one term to rule them all?","Hii all 

I've seen the term ""Python developer"" been around online, and the  roadmap to become one. As we all know, it does include many paths, web dev, analysis, DS, ML and so on. To be called a python dev, do we actually need to cover all potential paths and then just choose one? or we should be able to do anything under this big umbrella term? 

My question is coming from my interest in learning python and DS. That's when I started my journey. I am still in process of learning. But I also want to learn some kills related for backend dev via python. For many reasons, first even though my love goes for DS but there's less opportunities and more competition. (as far as I know). So, probably having extra skills can add value or come in handy for model production. Also, I won't mind working as backend dev, as I'll def use DS in research for later future plans. 

When I share this with someone, like my interest in DS and web dev. I got the response of these are totally different and I am heading to the wrong direction (well, maybe I am) but I wanted to cover my interest in more of a broader term like ""python dev"" but there's the fact that some of the  paths under this term I don't have much of interest in.

Should I specify myself as python dev with some specific libraries ""Generally speaking"". I do understand when it come to job haunting  I should be more specific like looking for DS, analysis...etc. 

But let's say I want include sth in my linkedin bio. I don't want to throw analysis, DS, ML, web dev all at once. I was considering python dev and then when it's come to job haunting I can pick and choose. 

I hope this is not a weird question :)",1649015670.0

reddit,Python,Introducing File Folder Hider! (made with Tkinter Python),"I've been working on this project for a couple of months now, first it was in the from of a terminal where the user had to give certain commands to get the job done, but now, its a fully-fledged GUI with buttons and labels to guide you. It has its two main features, ""Hide"" and ""Unhide"", which help you hide and unhide any file and/or folder from the File Explorer (more in the readme.txt). Moreover, you can opt in optionally to enter your email address and in case you ever forget the Master Password used to access the program, you can press the ""Forgot Password"" button to have a recovery code sent to your email and after verifying, you will be allowed to change the current Master Password, or if you happen to remember it again, simply go back to the main menu (because you've already verified yourself through the recovery procedure, it is safe to assume the user is the correct one). One thing to keep in mind is that all the credentials (the Master Password and your email address specifically) are encoded to ensure minimum security. At least that's better than none at all. Another important thing to note is that some command prompt screens will appear when running the program and hiding/unhiding the files/folders. That is a side-effect of trying to have the program run on the user level in order to get around permission issues and not running as admin, so sorry for that.

reddit,Python,A Redux inspired store pattern for asyncio applications - SimpleEventMonitor,"So, recently I had to deal with the issue of setting up a solution to monitor a few on-prem deployments for health status. The on-prem clusters were configured to send emails with multiple tables with the status of every node etc.

Well, it is a pretty straightforward solution was writing a python script to check the mailbox for new mail and download recent mail from the cluster, parse the mail and for each table entry verify for failed nodes and create an alert ticket of each node. I stumbled upon a [Github Project](https://github.com/wichmannpas/simple-mail-monitoring) that does something like this.

Considering the job was pretty much done, I was able to quickly use that script to do basic email retrieval and write parsers for my mail and get the job done in a few hours.

However,  the code felt very complicated and it was pretty much thrown away, but after giving it a few hours of solace at home, it occurred to me,  this kind of problem could be better tackled with queues or pubsub model and it has been a while I have played around with python.  I wanted to avoid the hassle of setting up Redis/rabbitmq etc, I was rather looking for something like redux for python applications, which I can use to separate out my data producers and consumers.

I had a few things in my mind for this side project :

\- In memory pubsub

\- Use asyncio

\- Be able to schedule events without cron tasks

\- Unobtrusive pattern to design my python code into producer and consumer model

\-  Ability to develop pull-based data sync, which can connect to your real time data feed

Here is the basic hello world program which demonstrates how you can create a publisher function and schedule it with run\_every to execute every 180 seconds after the last execution.

[aioredux hello world](https://preview.redd.it/6vb91s6accr81.png?width=3164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6de8ffdbda5fad9eb22404325887e8873a105c60)

Here is the link to my [fork](https://github.com/aregee/simple-mail-monitoring) of the Simple Mail Monitoring Github project, which utilizes this pattern to run the existing functionality provided by the original source.

I can't share my private repo, but I must say after moving that hackish script to this slightly better hack has made the code so clean and flexible, we have not just accomplished that email report task, but rather we are able to see many more such use cases internally where we can utilize this pattern.

reddit,Python,Beautiful circos plots in Python,"Circos is one of the most popular software packages for displaying the inter-relationships between data in a matrix. For example, in the bioinformatics field, circos style plots are often used for visualizing genomic similarities and features. However, the original package is implemented in Perl, and the other derived packages were also developed based on R or d3.js. Thus, there are no practical tools for drawing circos plots in matplotlib. 

Here, I made [pyCircos](https://github.com/ponnhide/pyCircos) that allow drawing circos plots with matplotlib. By using this package, not only circos plots but also complex polar plots can be quickly drawn.

I hope the package help users visualize a beautiful polar plot.

For years now, I have been developing and maintaining the [deep-translator](https://github.com/nidhaloff/deep-translator) package.

Recently, I started working on an API based on it and I want to show it to you. The API is based on fastapi and deep-translator. I deployed a ""basic"" version on azure, you can [try it out here](https://deep-translator-api.azurewebsites.net/)

If you want to check the API code, you can [find it here](https://github.com/nidhaloff/deep-translator-api)

I built the API as an extension to deep-translator to make it easier for other developers/enthusiasts to build apps/websites in their preferred languages and make use of deep-translator through the API. 

In [this issue](https://github.com/nidhaloff/deep-translator/issues/144), I suggested building a translation website or desktop app based on deep-translator. Maybe there are people here, who will find this interesting.

reddit,Python,py-terraform: Python binding for Terraform,"Hi, I wrote a Python binding for Terraform which called [**py-libterraform**](https://github.com/Prodesire/py-libterraform).

Terraform is a great tool for deploying resources. If you need to call the Terraform command in the Python program for deployment, a new process needs to be created to execute the Terraform command on the system. A typical example of this is the [python-terraform](https://github.com/beelit94/python-terraform) library. Doing so has the following problems:

* Requires Terraform commands on the system.
* The overhead of starting a new process is relatively high.

This library compiles Terraform as a **dynamic link library** in advance, and then loads it for calling. So there is no need to install Terraform, nor to start a new process.

In addition, since the Terraform dynamic link library is loaded, this library can further call Terraform's **internal capabilities**, such as parsing Terraform config files.

reddit,Python,A Vigenère (de)ciphering program with frequency analysis attack.,"The project can be found here: https://github.com/Nathan-Furnal/frequency-analysis

Hi everyone, this is a project about ciphers, entirely in Python. The goal is to provide a way to cipher plain text files based on a key and then automatically find the key back to decipher the text.

Some trade-offs were made for simplicity: only the basic 26 letters alphabet was allowed and any spaces or punctuation was removed as well.

In that sense, it's a good introduction to implement ciphering but not a real-world tool! 

More information about what a cipher is and how they're implemented can be found in the README and in the documentation of the code. 

We can start with the most simple example, a *Caesar* cipher which is a one letter shift. 

For example, the sentence `Hello World!`, shifted by the letter `K` (""a"" is 0 and ""k"" is 10), will become : 

    | H | E | L | L | O |  | W | O | R | L | D |  plain text
    | K | K | K | K | K |  | K | K | K | K | K |   key 
    | R | O | V | V | Y |  | G | Y | B | V | N |  ciphered text

This kind of cipher is very susceptible to be cracked because the letters are all shifted by the same key (a unique letter). Since that's the case, one can try to count the frequencies of each letter, plug back in the usual letter frequencies for each letter and it's done. 

A Vigenère cipher is more elaborate, the key is a word or a sentence and not one letter. Because of this, the same letters can be shifted by a different amount and the resulting ciphered text is not susceptible to the deciphering explained above. 

For example, The sentence `Hello World!`, encrypted with the word `key` (with letters indexed from 0 to 25), becomes: 

    | H | E | L | L | O |  | W | O | R | L | D |  plain text
    | K | E | Y | K | E |  | Y | K | E | Y | K |   key 
    | R | I | J | V | S |  | U | Y | V | J | N |  ciphered text

You'll find that where the key from this cipher matches the key from the previous one, the ciphered text matches! This is one of the basic building blocks used to attack this ciphering scheme, it's a bit more elaborate but you can find the references and examples in the documentation of the code.

reddit,Python,Removal of supported types in the sample function of the random-library. Why would this be done?,"When reading the [documentation of the random module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) I noded the following:

And my question is why would you do something like this, rather than further supporting all iterables and then casting them to sequences if needed. Maybe make a keyword only argument that has tuple as default parameter so that a user can pass in a custom function to convert non-sequence iterables and raise an error if and only if the convert function fails?

It started as a Django app, but several iterations in I realized I was basically just creating static pages (for speed of UX) so I pivoted to using Python for just a backend of querying the Hacker News API to get the link info and generate the page html and the thumbnails and other details. Web serving is just nginx serving the generated static html pages.

I'm happy to answer technical or design/architecture questions. My plan is to make the code public once it's in a less embarrassing state, but I'm happy to share source code as illustrations if anyone is curious about specific points.

Oddly, the thumbnails have consumed the majority of my dev time. I use Playwright to get the [og:image](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=og%3Aimage) link (if it's present) and then I use good ole `requests` to download the og:image itself. I use Wand (an ImageMagick binding) to trim away large blocks of solid color and then I pad the image to make it either squarish or a 3:1 width to height aspect ratio. Finally I use Wand to save the file as webp since it's small but still good looking. Currently I also create thumbnails if the linked item (not og:image but the actual link) is to a PDF. I'm using Wand to do the conversion with Inkscape as the backend delegate for rasterizing. But sometimes the quality is kinda meh, so I'd like to experiment with using good old ghostscript for rasterizing PDFs, either through a binding (any suggestions?) or by calling a process from Python to the shell.

[PEP 9001](https://peps.pythondiscord.com/pep-9001/)

Our friends over at the [Python Discord](https://discord.gg/python) have been asked to draft and submit a PEP based on their experiences on Discord based on how to make Python development better for all. 

As the Python Discord Server, they are in a unique position to see how  Python programmers grow along side the Python programming language.  With that experience, they've noticed how much developer time and energy is expended on python  formatting and how the guidelines of PEP8 even influence how people learn.

In an effort to ensure Python continues to be the dominant and best  programming language to ever exist, the Python Discord is submitting [PEP 9001](https://peps.pythondiscord.com/pep-9001/)—the New  Ultimate Final Python Formatting Guide! 

This PEP is the final, ultimate, complete Python Formatting Guide that  also includes proposed changes to the Python's syntax to encourage  better coding practices. We encourage you all to begin porting your code  to this new and final coding style.

To help with this drastic but very necessary change, they’ve started  drafting a new autoformatter for it, Blurple, so everyone can experience  what their code looks like in it's ultimate form.

This PEP is still in a draft state, so please suggest and make contributions in the #pep-9001 channel over in the [Python Discord](https://discord.gg/python). Play around with the autoformatter in #blurple-code-formatter and experience what it’s like for your code to be expertly styled.",1648771923.0

reddit,Python,Create a progression of recommendations with any recommender,"Hi! For work I made a [recommendation progression package](https://github.com/askarthur/graph-progression) which we've open sourced! Let me explain.

# Reason

We are an ArtTech company and have created a few recommendation engines around artists and artworks. For the artwork one in particular, we thought it'd be cool to see a progression of artworks given a ""seed"" work. During that process, we discovered a solution like this doesn't exist when all the recommendations aren't calculated before hand and stored (like a graph database) ... so we built this.

# Summary

The main idea behind the package is to allow users to create a series of recommendations in a sort of ""progression"" from one another using a *context-based* recommender. So you supply the recommendation engine (or client to it), the starter item (seed), and the progression length. It will then try to create a progression of recommendations from the start (seed -&gt; rec 1 -&gt; rec 2 -&gt; etc.).

Some cool features it has are memoization (it won't call the recommender again if it hits the item again), backtracking (if an item has no valid recommendations), and post-selection filters (if you want to filter out certain recommendations).

## Sample

Checkout out a [sample](https://github.com/askarthur/graph-progression/blob/main/docs/samples/README.md) (for artworks) starting with a VanGogh painting!

reddit,Python,A feature complete W-TinyLFU cache implementation in Python,"While learning Python I tried to implement the cache architecture proposed in the paper [A Highly Efficient Cache Admission Policy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00727.pdf). I have seen that Python only propose LRU cache as a decorator so I thought a more efficient cache was something meaningful and funny to code.  
Not an expert, tried my best.

Brief description of the cache structure:

&gt;W-TinyLFU uses a small admission LRU that evicts to a large Segmented LRU if accepted by the TinyLfu admission policy. TinyLfu relies on a frequency sketch to probabilistically estimate the historic usage of an entry. The window allows the policy to have a high hit rate when entries exhibit recency bursts which would otherwise be rejected. The size of the window vs main space is adaptively determined using a hill climbing optimization. This configuration enables the cache to estimate the frequency and recency of an entry with low overhead.

reddit,Python,"I wrote okjson - A fast, simple, and pythonic JSON Schema Validator","I had a requirement to process and validate large payloads of JSON concurrently for a web service, initially I implemented it using [jsonschema](https://github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema) and [fastjsonschema](https://github.com/horejsek/python-fastjsonschema) but I found the whole [JSON Schema Specification](https://json-schema.org/) to be confusing at times and on top of that wanted better performance. Albeit there are ways to compile/cache the schema, I wanted to move away from the schema specification so I wrote a validation library inspired by the design of [tiangolo/sqlmodel](https://github.com/tiangolo/sqlmodel) (type hints) to solve this problem easier.

**Here is a simple example:**

```py
from okjson import JSONValidator

schema = { 'name': str, 'age': int }

json_string = '{ ""name"": ""Charly Gordon"", ""age"": 32 }'

assert JSONValidator().is_valid(instance=json_string, schema=schema)
```

There is an [example covering all the features](https://github.com/mufeedvh/okjson#every-feature-in-a-single-example) in the README.

It also has well defined exceptions for each error case when you want to get the reason for the validation failure. (Helpful when you want to show user facing error messages)

reddit,Python,^fassert$: Fuzzy assert only data that matters,"Hello,

In almost every project I worked on I had a need to fuzzy match (assert) recursively nested structures such as combinations of lists/dicts/tuples/sets etc... If you need to assert some data deep within the nested structures, especially if the position within the list is not known, the complexity can raise quickly with several nested for loops. I always wrote more-or-less the same test fixture to do this kind of thing but figured I am not the only one having this problem so I decided to made this into a small library with emphasis of having 0 dependencies.

The whole library is also implemented in a single file (I would like to keep it that way if possible) so if you don't feel like installing something from pypi you can just copy paste the content into your pytest fixtures and start using it straight away.

reddit,Python,Introducing Slap: A CLI to assist in the Python development process,"I would like to share a project with you that I have been working on and actively using for over 1.5 years to streamline my day-to-day tasks developing Python projects. I use Slap tens to hundreds of times a day and would not want to miss it anymore.

**Slap streamlines Python development tasks**

&gt;[Slap](https://niklasrosenstein.github.io/slap/) is a command-line tool to assist in the development of Python projects independent of the [PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/) build backend being used, capable of managing single- and multi-project repositories.

Among the things that Slap can do, here is a short selection:

* Perform development installs of your project (even for Poetry projects)
* Manage local &amp; global virtual environments
* Bump version numbers (not just in `pyproject.toml`)
* Publish to PyPI
* Manage structured changelogs in TOML format
* All while capable of handling mono-repositories that consist of more than one Python project

*--- Check out the*  [*Getting started*](https://niklasrosenstein.github.io/slap/getting-started/) *page in the documentation to get a more in-depth look into what Slap can do for you. ---*

**Slap seems similar to the Poetry CLI, what's different?**

Some people might find this similar to tools like Poetry, and while there is some overlap in functionality, Slap is **not a build backend** and is more targeted towards library development. Most of my projects use Poetry as the build backend but I never even once interact with the Poetry CLI throughout the lifetime of the project.

The most notable differences to Poetry are

* Slap supports mono-repositories (i.e. multiple related Python projects in the same repository), to the extent that it bumps version numbers of project inter-dependencies and installs your projects in topological order
* Slap supports development installs independent of the build backend (yes; this means you can install Poetry packages in editable mode even though the Poetry backend right now does not support editable installs)
* Slap's version bump command (`slap release`) updates the version not just in your `pyproject.toml` but also the `__version__` in your source code  as well as in related projects (see mono-repositories above) and any additional references you can configure via Regex patterns
* Slap does not automagically create a virtual environment for you when installing your project(s); instead, it errors when you try to install into a non-virtual Python environment and gives you an easy-to-use tool to create and activate virtual environments (and allowing multiple environments per project as well as global environments)
* Slap uses Pip to install your project(s), unlike Poetry which comes with its own dependency resolver and package installer (which I have been having a lot of issues with in the past).
* Slap does not have a concept of lock files

**Ideas / Suggestions / Contributions**

Slap is currently very opinionated by the fact alone that I built it as my personal workflow tool, but I welcome suggestions and contributions, and I am hopeful it will be useful to a wider audience than myself.

These terms are used frequently, but many seem to often disagree on them. Could be used to describe a persons knowledge, competence, or the qualiry od code/codebase etc.

I would say a beginner is just someone who is learning the actual language, syntax, just learning to code. Maybe touching on the common built-in libraries, learning classes, and basic OOP.

Intermediate is past the syntax and basic concepts and is using libraries. Intermediate is a lot longer phase, I think. Intermediate is learning about programming concepts, practices, patterns, design, libraries, ...  

Advanced (again, in my perspective) is not a wizard who knows Python internals and corners of the python object model. It's someone who can create useful, well-structured programs from the ground up properly, using the right tools and libraries. Not just doing practice projects, but a larger product properly. Able to pretty much learn any technology needed for a project.

reddit,Python,What is a Lambda function and its applications in Python,"In this short article, I'm gonna explain Python's lambda functions in detail. A lambda function is a small anonymous function that can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. Here is its syntax:

**lambda arguments : expression**

The expression is executed and the result is returned.

## Example:

Add 10 to argument a, and return the result:

    x = lambda a : a + 10
    print(x(5))

The result would be 15. (You could try this in a python IDE such as vs code)

=========================================================================

Lambda functions can take any number of arguments:

## Example:

Multiply argument a with argument b and return the result:

    x = lambda a, b : a * b
    print(x(5, 6))

The result would be 30.

=========================================================================

**Why Use Lambda Functions?**

The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another function. Say you have a function definition that takes one argument, and that argument will be multiplied by an unknown number:

    def myfunc(n):
      return lambda a : a * n

Use that function definition to make a function that always doubles the number you send in:

## Example:

    def myfunc(n):
      return lambda a : a * n
    
    mydoubler = myfunc(2)
    print(mydoubler(11))

The result would be 22.

=========================================================================

Use lambda functions when an anonymous function is required for a short period of time.

reddit,Python,My first coding project: Twitter Plays Wordle,"After starting my coding journey 3 months ago, I've finally made something that isn't a terminal calculator app :0

So I made [Twitter Plays Wordle](https://twitter.com/WordleGame_Bot) ([github](https://github.com/afnzmn/twitter-plays-wordle)), a twitter bot that uses replies to its tweet as guesses for a Wordle game.

The bot first checks if it's a fresh game. If yes, it tweets a blank Wordle grid. If it isn't, then it searches for the replies to its newest tweet, and checks to see if it has a guess in it. This can either be a reply with just a five letter word, or a five letter \[guess\] contained in square brackets. It adds this to a replies.csv. Then, it sorts the guesses by the likes, and uses the most liked valid reply as the guess. It then plugs the guess into a Wordle function, which just runs an algorithm for detecting what coloured square goes where, and adding it to a list. The list then gets joined and pushed out with other Wordle things for the Twitter bot to tweet. Finally, it adds the Wordle grid into a text file, and updates a csv on the current row position, the word number, and the win state to be used for the next tweet.

If you want to play it, here's the most [recent tweet](https://twitter.com/WordleGame_Bot/status/1508769809550434309)

reddit,Python,Sourcepy: source python files straight from the shell,"Hey folks, sharing a project I built just for fun, Sourcepy: [https://github.com/dchevell/sourcepy](https://github.com/dchevell/sourcepy)

I was writing some increasingly messy shell functions and thought it would be nice if I could just write Python functions/variables/etc. instead and source them from the shell. So … that's what this is. It uses a mix of importlib and inspect machinery to ""source"" files (in reality, generating shell stubs that hook back into a bridging interface, and aliasing \`source\` so it works just like you’d expect).

Along the way I ended up deep diving into type annotations and turning plain python functions into dynamic command line apps that can coerce to native values, handle stdin, work with a large variety of types &amp; objects and do a number of other interesting things - all without your code having to know a thing about Sourcepy. You write plain old python functions, add typehints to the parameters for the best results, and in most cases it should ""just work"".\*

This is still a work in progress - its use case is largely for folks like me who like excuses to mess around in Python and customise their environment and toolset to an unnecessary degree. 

Try it out, share any suggestions (or bugs, or criticism). I've poked around looking for similar projects and the only similar thing I could find required running a daemon which wasn't an approach I liked, so hopefully you'll find some novelty here.

First of all, I change the code structure to classes and objects.
then add one decent functionality -

Previously, to show the expenses more clearly I use graphs.
Now, I made another option of changing the currency of your expenses and compare it from the previous. Here, I have used tan API.

# INSTALLATION AND CODE
You can see the code as usual on github - [here](https://github.com/Shreejan-35/EXPENSE-TRACKER). Here you can get all information.

You can install it using pip by the following ways - 
```
pip install expense-tracker
```
OR
```
pip3 install exprense-tracker
```

Then run,
```
expense-tracker
```

I was lucky that no one has till now taken **expense-tracker** as a name.

reddit,Python,What type of language is Python?,"I use python in all my classes and got into a discussion with my students about what type of language python is.

Initially, I thought python is a completely ""non-typed"" language because we are able to suppress types while declaring variables and parameters:

*def func(a, b): ...*

But then I found out that it's possible to type things up explicitly:

*def func(a: int, b: int) -&gt; int: ...*

I ended up categorizing python as an ""implicitly typed"" language, and the interpreter must fill the types I don't explicitly add to the code. However, one of my students pointed out that, as python admits dynamic typing, it is a ""dynamically typed language"", which is the official classification (?).

However, I have failed to wrap my mind around the fact that I can explicitly set the types, but the interpreter won't bat an eye in case I recast my variables:

*def func(a: int, b: int) -&gt; int:*

*...c: int = a + b*

*...return c*

*d: int = func(1, 2)*

*print(d)*

*d = ""dynamically typed?""*

*print(d)*

Is ""weakly-typed dynamic language"" a possible way to classify python?",1648435995.0

Video of it running: [https://youtu.be/7J2Pn8me7m8](https://youtu.be/7J2Pn8me7m8)

Github link: [https://github.com/E-Parker/Terminal-3D-Render/releases](https://github.com/E-Parker/Terminal-3D-Render/releases)

I've been working on this for a little while, it's a simple 3D render engine that uses only the built-in python libraries.

NOTE: If you suffer from any conditions that cause sensitivity to flashing lights do not use PREVIOUS versions of this program. The latest version is safe and free of flickering.Because the print command is very slow sometimes the screen will refresh before python is done drawing the frame, this causes the image to flicker occasionally. The effect worsens the faster your monitor's refresh rate is.

The features of this version are:- BMP decoding

\- OBJ decoding

\- Perspective Texture mapping

\- Depth buffer

\- Simple directional lighting

\- 231 colours!

I don't think there is much to be learned from this other than how not to write a render engine, I spent a lot of time working out how to do things like decoding .bmp files when there are already solutions that are way faster and much less of a pain to work with. This was mostly an exercise to see how far I could go without any tools.

Actually, with this , we can store our passwords pretty securely until our key is exposed.

So, I have used -

i. sqlite3 (Used for database)

ii. cryptograhy (To work with encryption and decryption using the key)

These are the libraries.

I used fernet to generate the key and to encrypt and decrypt the passwords and storing it in the database.

The script provides a list of options -

i. Create a database

ii. Work with previous database

iii. Generate key

iv. Load key

v. Retrive passwords

You can see the code here - [https://github.com/Shreejan-35/PYVAULT/](https://github.com/Shreejan-35/PYVAULT/)

reddit,Python,I made my first gui program!,"I finally made a gui using tkinter. Its a super simple program that takes in an image and then makes it into text art using the braille unicode characters.

Not many ive told have been interested or understood so I thought I should try here.  
[https://imgur.com/gallery/kMth4Cn](https://imgur.com/gallery/kMth4Cn)  


For those curious Ill explain my process  
I use tkinter to make a menu with all the settings and when you click generate it runs my image algorithm  


The algorithm is pretty simple and uses pillow  
Using pillow I get an image and convert it to black and white  


Then I use two for loops to go through the grid of data. It starts and the 0,0 pixel. It then grabs a 2 wide and 3 tall chunk of values. If the values are above the contrast value they are then set to a 1, else its a 0.  


Then I reorganize the list of values of a chunk into a binary number. This is because the unicode counts up in binary. So once i arrange all the numbers to their binary number. I just convert that number to the unicode character. Then i save that chunk to a list. I do this for ever chunk on that layer. It then moves down and repeats until we have a matrix of braille characters.  


Finally it just prints those arrays to a txt file  


The image kinda depends on how the text is displayed. On windows its inconsistent based on the zoom, certain levels of zoom cause distortions.

It basically converts Image/live video to ascii art (can save as Image or text) using openCV.

Currently it does not save video and only supports black/white and white/black coloring(my initial goal was to make it look a bit retro - if that makes any sense).

I would love to hear your suggestions on how it could be improved on and what features could be added!

[https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/development/release\_notes.html](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/development/release_notes.html)

&amp;#x200B;

* New Features 
   * Arcade can now run in headless mode on linux servers **opening more possibilities for users in for example the data science** community ([\#1107](https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/1107)). See [Headless Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/advanced/headless.html#headless) for more information.
* Bugfixes
   * The random text glitching issue especially affecting users with iGPUs is finally resolved in pyglet. For that reason we have upgraded to the pyglet 2.0a2 release.
   * Fixed an issue causing [arcade.draw\_circle\_filled()](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/api/drawing_primitives.html#arcade.draw_circle_filled) and [arcade.draw\_circle\_outline()](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/api/drawing_primitives.html#arcade.draw_circle_outline) to always render with 3 segments on some iGPUs.
   * Fixed an issue causing interactive widgets to unnecessarily re-draw when hovering or pressing them. This could cause performance issues.
   * SectionManager’s on\_show\_view  
 was never called when showing a view
* Various Improvements
   * [arcade.load\_font()](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/api/text_pyglet.html#arcade.load_font) now supports resource handles
   * [PhysicsEngineSimple](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/api/physics_engines.html#arcade.PhysicsEngineSimple) can now take an iterable of wall spritelists
   * Sprite creation is now \~6-8% faster.
   * Removed warning about missing shapely on startup
   * Window titles are now optional. If no window title is specified the title will be the absolute path to the python file it was created in. This was changed because of the new headless mode.
   * Removed arcade.quick\_run  
. This function had no useful purpose.
   * Added clear method to UIManager ([\#1116](https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/pull/1116))
   * Updated from Pillow 9.0.0 to 9.0.1
* Tilemap
   * Rectangle objects which are empty(have no width or height) will now be automatically converted into single points.
   * The Tile ID of a sprite can be access with sprite.properties\[""tile\_id""\]  
. This refers to the local ID of the tile within the Tileset. This value can be used to get the tile info for a given Sprite created from loading a tilemap.
* Docs
   * Added python version support info to install instructions ([\#1122](https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/pull/1122))
   * Fixed typo in [append\_texture()](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/api/sprites.html#arcade.Sprite.append_texture) docstring([\#1126](https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/pull/1126))
   * Improved the raycasting tutorial ([\#1124](https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/1124))
   * Replace mentions of 3.6 on Linux install page ([\#1129](https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/pull/1129))
   * Fix broken links in the homepage ([\#1139](https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/pull/1130))
   * Lots of other improvements to docstrings throughout the code base
   * General documentation improvements
* OpenGL
   * [arcade.gl.Geometry](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/gl/geometry.html#arcade.gl.Geometry) now supports transforming to multiple buffers.
   * Added and improved examples in experimental/examples
   * Major improvements to API docs

You may thing: ""well... creating a Deep Learning architecture is like magic"". You are right. A few blueprints help one to get an idea how an architecture may look like. But improving e.g., the number of filters, layers, activations functions etc. is something that MUST be automatized. To tackle this, the next session will show ""Keras Tuner"" to automatize exactly this!

Whenever I write a while loop, I always want to limit the number of iterations it can run to avoid infinite loops while developing the program,  what would the most pythonic way of doing that?

theres obviously the basic

            yield n

reddit,Python,PIPELY - new lightweight pipeline library,"hey there, just released a new version of `pipely` \- a lightweight pipeline library that can trigger any sequence of classes in any order.

# Simple Example:

create `collect.yaml` 

    steps:
        a1_print:
            exec: src/file1.py:firstA
        a2_print:
            exec: src/file1.py:secondA
        final_print:
            exec: src/file2.py:printDone
            depends_on:
            - a1_print
            - a2_print

`depends_on` parameter sets the following order for pipely:

1. firstly it parallelly executes `firstA` and `secondA` classes (`a1_print` and `a2_print` steps) from file `src/file1.py` 
2. and then executes  `printDone` class (step `final_print`) from file `src/file2.py`

It also allows **value transformations** between classes and other cool things.

reddit,Python,Encrypto - A simple way of complicating/encrypting data,"This is a repost I made to fit community guidelines.

*Meet Encrypto, a revolutionary technology that can protect your data from the government **(Joke Intended)** and prevent the Feds from understanding your text.*

The code itself does a simple task. When asked to encrypt data, it will generate two random keys. One till be used for the Caesar Cipher offset and the other defines how many times the symmetric algorithm is run. This will give out a gibberish looking string, which is then converted into a BrainF\*\*k *like* looking code. Wrong keys during decryption will give you the erroneous data.

Note that since each character is encoded with 8-characters, and that the Base64 encryption happens multiple times, file size may skyrocket. 

I visualized this concept a long time ago, but spent some months completely understanding Python and the logic required (Encryption types, etc.). This code was designed to mimic the Enigma machine with its separate codes for different encryption types.

Here's the link to the code:

reddit,Python,How to create a digital clock with python easily," This tutorial is about creating a project using python language. I’m going to show you how to create a digital clock with Python. Before reading the article, if you like to know more about Python, you could check out these two important articles:

* [Why should I learn Python?](https://progskillss.com/why-should-i-learn-python)
* [How to learn Python?](https://progskillss.com/how-to-learn-python-programming)

This project is suitable for beginners. To write the code, you need to know how to use modules in Python. Two necessary modules that I use in this project are Tkinter and time. Tkinter is a GUI library that helps you develop a graphical user interface for the digital clock, and using the time module; you could get the current time, date, timezone, etc. Let’s dive deep into these modules.

[RaViewer demo](https://i.redd.it/s4m2bmsa7bp81.gif)

[RaViewer](https://github.com/antmicro/raviewer) is an open-source utility dedicated to parsing and displaying binary data acquired straight from camera. After opening a binary image, you can specify the color format, the image size and append or remove n bytes from the beginning of the image series. The binary image will be processed and shown based on these values. You can control which color channels are displayed and zoom in and out. For detailed information, you can view the hexadecimal pixel values in table format. The resulting image can be exported entirely or just a selected part to more complex formats (JPEG, PNG) or raw data. The source code is available in the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/antmicro/raviewer).

You can read more about RaViewer in this [article](https://antmicro.com/blog/2021/11/raviewer-open-source-tool-for-debugging-video-pipelines/) by [antmicro](https://antmicro.com/).

I will modify it later to do the same thing for non-WordPress website, by analyzing the sitemap.

It goes through all the posts one by one from WordPress API, extract all the URLs from &lt;a&gt; tag and then checks their status by making a HEAD request.

404 and other status codes are recorded. If the HEAD request fails, then name of the exception class is recorded.

Finally, save the report in CSV file.

Hiring developers doesn't feel like a solution for me. I would love to build projects together with other ""advanced"" programmers and exchange ideas, learn from each other, inspire each other. But how do I find people who are interested aswell?

The Solution:

A more private, trustbased community of developers, who have time and energy to contribute unpaid work to programming projects. People could share and discuss ideas, group together in teams and start projects. Also if there is an intention to turn projects profitable teams could determine at the beginning how profits will be shared. I imagine this community as a discord server right now, but could be something else of cause.

reddit,Python,Creating a Python CLI with Go(lang)-comparable startup times,"Hi Folks.

I recently put some effort into creating a command line interface (CLI) made with Python.

Background: I started a new project called Gefyra, a tool for local application development directly with Kubernetes. Check it out the website [https://gefyra.dev](https://gefyra.dev) or have a glance at the code [https://github.com/gefyrahq/gefyra/tree/main/client](https://github.com/gefyrahq/gefyra/tree/main/client)

I'd like to have an executable with (almost) the startup performance of `kubectl` (the executable to control a Kubernetes cluster). That means, I need fast startup times (which is crucial for a CLI) and ideally just one file (which is statically-linked) for easy distribution. In addition, I’d like to provide executables for Windows, MacOS and Linux. For those requirements people would usually go for Go (needless to say it's awesome), however I started out with a prototype written in Python and it evolved over time. So I tried to find a way to make this work with Python.

I went the following way:

1. PyInstaller: [https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
2. Nuitka: [https://nuitka.net/](https://nuitka.net/)
3. PyOxidizer: [https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

**PyInstaller**

PyInstaller was quite easy to set up. However, the resulting executable was complained about by Virustotal (see: [https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)) because of PyInstaller's bootloader. Somehow the code signature was also found in viruses (lol). To workaround this I compiled a bootloader myself which at least removed the virus issues. 

On MacOS I faced startup times of more than 10 s with internet connection and about 3 s without internet connection. Interestingly, the former docker-compose command was also created from PyInstaller and Mac users complained about the startup performance, too: [https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6956](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6956) :)

I didn’t find much to improve. The concept of PyInstaller will potentially always be a problem for fast startup times (which IMHO makes it unsuitable for CLI applications).

**Nuitka**

With Nuitka, I generated very large binaries of about 150 Mb. The startup performance was already much better than PyInstaller for Mac and Linux. However, I was not completely satisfied and very long compile times bothered me a little bit (about 10 min).

**PyOxidizer**

I ended up using PyOxidizer. This well-crafted toolkit compiles Python to Rust code and also includes all dependencies into one handy binary executable. With no special optimizations I saw startup times of about 700 ms. That is almost acceptable, though I wanted to go a little further.

I started to examine the output of `python -X importtime -m gefyra 2&gt; import.log` just to check the imports. There is an awesome tool to analyze the Python imports: tuna (see: [https://github.com/nschloe/tuna](https://github.com/nschloe/tuna)). `tuna` allows analyzing the import times from the log. Run it like so `tuna import.log`. It opens a browser window and visualizes the import times. With that I was able to manually move all imports to the functions in which they are needed (and bring in some other optimizations). This greatly violates PEP 8 ([https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#imports](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#imports)) but leads to very fast startup times.

These are the startup values I finally reached with `gefyra` under average modern Ubuntu:

    &gt; python -m timeit ""__import__('os').system(gefyra)""  
    10 loops, best of 5: 33.5 msec per loop  

Pretty neat, isn’t it?   
In comparison the `kubectl` executable:

    &gt; python -m timeit ""__import__('os').system('kubectl')""  
    10 loops, best of 5: 24.9 msec per loop  

In addition, I created GitHub actions to run the PyOxidizer builds once a new version is released (see: [https://github.com/gefyrahq/gefyra/blob/main/.github/workflows/dist-build-linux.yaml](https://github.com/gefyrahq/gefyra/blob/main/.github/workflows/dist-build-linux.yaml)). Only Windows is missing at the moment.

Although, PyInstaller and Nuitka did not deliver the best startup times, I would not say it's bad software. They probably shine at other aspects.

I hope these insights can be useful for someone else, too.",1648057171.0

**edit**

A simple tool to iterate coordinates within given boundaries.  
The usage is mostly for querying/searching by location.   
Geoiter provides many locations within a boundary, like a country.   
Let's say Germany has in sum 5000 houses to sell. Then most platforms will only allow you to visit the first 200 houses.   
Now to get the others, you need to dissect the big boundary area into smaller ones.  
And this is where geoiter provides you with coordinates

In many cases the web page restrict the result items to a fixed number. With geoiter you can now dissect this one query to a many location queries to relax the result density under the restriction limit.

geoiter has only one additional dependency called [haversine](https://pypi.org/project/haversine/).

## install

    pip install geoiter

## usage

    import pickle
    
    from geoiter.util.ressource_example import germany
    from geoiter import GeoIter
    
    # get you boundary for example
    with open(germany, ""rb"") as file:
        germany = pickle.load(file)
    
    # prepare
    gi = GeoIter(
        boundary=germany,
        radius=100,
        comp_rate=20
        )
    
    if __name__ == ""__main__"":
        # plot them as example
        for coordinate in gi:
            print(coordinate)

## speed

one may consider that geo data have mb of coordinates. Which may make the this iteration very slow, because it needs to look up coordinates in the boundary often. To accelerate the **geoiter** provides a very simple compressor and uses bisect instead of list iteration. However, it still can be slow.

## extensions

There two extensions which give additional help

    pip install geoiter[""gpx]

provides you with an gpx exporter.

    pip install geoiter[""plot""]

provides a plotting function to visualize the grid.

## data

* Automatically check the type and range of input parameters and pretty print them.
* Easy extension of parameter types and GUI widgets.

## Application and Limitations

Provides interfaces to programs in a very simple way. For example converting functions directly into a web apps for people who don't know how to use the command line. The limitation is that it is only suitable for creating simple interfaces.

reddit,Python,LinkedIn Researchers Open-Source ‘FastTreeSHAP’: A Python Package That Enables An Efficient Interpretation of Tree-Based Machine Learning Models,"Researchers from LinkedIn open-source the FastTreeSHAP package which is a Python module based on the paper ‘[Fast TreeSHAP: Accelerating SHAP Value Computation for Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09847).’ Implementing the widely-used TreeSHAP algorithm in the SHAP package allows for the efficient interpretation of tree-based machine learning models by estimating sample-level feature significance values. Its package includes two new algorithms: FastTreeSHAP v1 and FastTreeSHAP v2, both of which improve TreeSHAP’s computational efficiency by taking a different approach. 

The empirical benchmarking tests show that FastTreeSHAP v1 is 1.5x faster than TreeSHAP while keeping memory costs the same, and FastTreeSHAP v2 is 2.5x faster while using slightly more memory. The FastTreeSHAP package fully supports parallel multi-core computing to speed up its computation.

today I would like to show you a new tutorial  video within my Space Science with Python series. I am still working on a  Machine Learning project, and this time we will use TensorFlow / Keras  to create a multi-class classifier for our asteroids reflectance  spectra.

Since our spectra data are already perfectly cleaned and  processed, even a simple Dense layer architecture provides fair  results; you'll see! And for starters, Dense-layer-based networks are  easy to ""digest"".

The next video will consider convolution  networks and afterwards you will see some nice Autoencoder architecture  and unsupervised classification methods. Hopefully you'll like it!

Anyway.  A word of ""warning"". When I create my tutorials I prepare my code, test  it, format it, test it again etc. Also this time. But: I had some  functions in the Google Colab cache. My ""new"" functions were not called  correctly and I figured it out in the last minutes! Anyway, I left it in  the video for others to learn from my mistake I made there. Please  note: reset your runtime when you start something new and be aware of  issues when using Notebooks in a productive environment.

reddit,Python,"PyMacApp: Build, Package, and Code-Sign Python Projects on MacOS in just 10-lines of Python Code!","Hi All:

I recently posted about a project I was working on called PyMacApp. I just released a ton of updates that brings full support for building, packaging, and code-signing in as little as just 10 lines of code (2 import statements, 4 for the app, and 4 for the package; it supports function chaining, so you could even accomplish this in less than 10 lines)!

Get started with ```pip3 install pymacapp```
GH: https://github.com/The-Nicholas-R-Barrow-Company-LLC/PyMacApp

A more-detailed starter is available below. 

```
# build.py

# Apple Account Information
# You can get rid of the input(...) functions and instead enter the strings directly so you do not have to enter them each time.
APPLE_DEVELOPER_ACCOUNT_EMAIL = input(""Apple Developer ID Email (str): "")
APPLE_DEVELOPER_ACCOUNT_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD = input(""Apple Developer ID App-Specific Password (str): "")

app = App(""My New App"", ""com.identifier"")

So i built a self driving car with python in need for speed most wanted(2005). I was really impressed when i saw nvidia build their own self driving car with just a single algorithm(cnn) so i decided to try it myself. Basically i record training data while i'm playing the game (i played around 2 hours i think) my key presses associated with every frame are recorded. Later i process this training data and train the algorithm (which is almost the same as the nvidia's). Latest step is just running the algo. Important hings i've used are: numpy, opencv, matplotlib and pytorch. 

Please take a look at the code i tried to document everything and i would appreciate any pull requests and advice in general :)",1647686990.0

reddit,Python,Red Mail: All you need from an email sender,"Hi all,

I have made a couple of posts about Red Mail in the past but I recently received some comments feeling this being underrated compared to how useful it really is. So, I hope you don't mind an update,  I also just released a new version.

So what is Red Mail? It's an email library that aims for simplicity without compromising features. You will find a bunch of email senders from Pypi but there is nothing quite like this.

So what can it do?

* [Supports sending HTML, text, attachments](https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/sending.html)
* [Send to regular receivers, cc (carbon copy) or bcc (blind carbon copy)](https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/sending.html)
* [Attachments from various types: paths, bytes, Pandas dataframes, etc.](https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/attachments.html)
* [Emails with embedded images in HTML](https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/body_content.html#embedding-content)
* [Embedded images from various types: Matplotlib plots or PIL images](https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/body_content.html#embedding-content)
* [Emails with embedded (prettified) tables from Pandas dataframes](https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/body_content.html#embedded-tables)
* [Templated emails using Jinja](https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/jinja_support.html)
* [Gmail and Outlook pre-configured](https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/config.html)
* [Logging handlers!](https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions/logging.html)
* [Flask integration](https://flask-redmail.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)

A minimal example for Gmail users:

    from redmail import gmail
    
    gmail.username = ""example@gmail.com""
    gmail.password = ""&lt;MY PASSWORD&gt;""
    
    gmail.send(
        sender=""example@gmail.com"",
        receivers=[""you@example.com""],
        subject=""An example email"",
        html=""""""
            &lt;h1&gt;Hi,&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;nice to meet you.&lt;/p&gt;
        """""",
    )

More advanced features:

    from redmail import EmailSender
    
    email = EmailSender(host=""smtp.myhost.com"", port=0)
    
    email.send(
        sender=""me@example.com"",
        receivers=[""you@example.com""],
        subject=""An example email"",
        html=""""""
            &lt;h1&gt;Hi {{ friend }},&lt;/h1&gt; 
            &lt;p&gt;look at this image:&lt;/p&gt;
            {{ nice_image }}
        """""",
        body_params={""friend"": ""Jack""},
        body_images={""nice_image"": 'path/to/image.png'},
        attachments={""file.csv"": pd.DataFrame({""col"": [1, 2, 3]})}
    )

So it's pretty clean and does everything you wished from an email sender. There are alternatives for email sending but nothing quite like this. It is also well tested and documented.

Resources:

* Source code: [https://github.com/Miksus/red-mail](https://github.com/Miksus/red-mail)
* Documentation: [https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Releases: [https://pypi.org/project/redmail/](https://pypi.org/project/redmail/)

If you need to integrate it to a Flask application:

* Source code: [https://github.com/Miksus/flask-redmail](https://github.com/Miksus/flask-redmail)
* Documentation: [https://flask-redmail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://flask-redmail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Releases: [https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Redmail/](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Redmail/)

So what has changed? Now the email structures are more structured and more likely gets rendered across email providers, fixed a bug related to embedded emails and aliases and improved documentation.

If you found it useful, leave it a star on Github. That's the way to get visibility and it lets me know I'm building useful things in my free time. Thanks again for all the support!",1647681015.0
reddit,Python,I created a super simple customizable desktop clock with python,"Have you ever wanted to program a simple clock for your desktop? This [Simple Desktop Clock](https://github.com/underpig1/simplest-desktop-clock) uses python's tkinter to create a desktop clock for cleaner layouts. The best part is, you can customize how it looks and where it appears on your screen really easily, and it will change colors based on your wallpaper colors. I created this program a few weeks back because I was annoyed with the tiny clock in the bottom right of my screen and wanted something like the big clock on the lock screen. I decided to share it when I heard others were encountering a similar problem. The clock functions just as a part of your wallpaper--as in, you can't drag it or click on it, and it by default stays behind your windows. Let me know if you enjoy it or find it useful!

reddit,Python,A Happy Success Story and Python!,"Hi everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to share some exciting events, as well as a good story for those maybe demotivated learning Python.

&amp;#x200B;

Like many of you, I started learning Python (around 3-4 months ago), and quickly felt overwhelmed by just the huge mass of tutorials, libraries, and posts. However, I pushed through it, and have made some real progress!

&amp;#x200B;

Today I launched v1 of my AI/startup business [https://finned.tech](https://finned.tech) \- selling a (Python) solution for personalized marketing on digital billboards, a solution now patent-pending. In addition to this, I built a licensing solution from the ground up, again using Python, and finally a Python webserver (using FastAPI) to handle auth, license checks, and payments.

&amp;#x200B;

What I learned from all of this (besides that it's hard to start a business), is that if you keep persevering, watching those tutorials, and building those things you think no one will ever use, that, before you know it, you'll be creating things you never thought possible before!

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this post has inspired some of you to put a bit more effort into learning and building some projects, as I know many posts here did with me.

reddit,Python,"I've heard that ""if a class is just a constructor and one method, then it should be a function"". What is your opinion on this and what are counter examples?","I watched a seminar a few years ago about someone talking about the misuses of OOP in python and talked extensively about the case where people write a class, implement the `__init__()` method and one extra method and that's it.

He provided examples and showed functional code that simplifies the solution to a few lines and he said:

&gt; ""If a class is just a constructor and one method, then it shouldn't be a class at all. It should be a function.""

I can't find the video anymore, but I was just wondering what reddit thinks about this statement and if you have any counter examples or in what cases it could be useful.

I'm also interested in the cases where if it is true, how would that functional implementation look like when I need some sort of a state to persist.

I've been thinking that the next step has to be merging together the threading and process level into a single langauge. This got me thinking with little change why not support the following language syntax/semantics:

&amp;#x200B;

typeOfEnttity := 'process' | 'thread';

func := \[async \[typeOfEntity\]\] def ....

&amp;#x200B;

The idea is that if I say 

def foo() ... it is the Python standard.

&amp;#x200B;

If I say

async def foo()  or async thread def foo()  ... 

 we have the asyncio stuff we have today.

&amp;#x200B;

If  I say

async process def foo() ....

I have it using the multiprocess support of Python. I think this movies python in the ""right"" direction. I'm wondering what you all think about this proposal?",1647606312.0

reddit,Python,"A solver, player and cheater for breaklock","I stumbled upon [breaklock](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/breaklock.html) recently. Since it was a bit too much for me, I set up a program to solve it.

The solving mode works by first finding all possible solutions, then whittling down the options based on feedback from the game, I can explain further if required.

The player mode simply asks the player to make moves until they win.

I love the cheating mode idea, which just popped into my head. Essentially, when the player gets the correct answer, it changes it while ensuring no contradictions happen. Like you do in hangman. On average, it slows down the machine by \~1 turn, and humans by \~5 turns

reddit,Python,Package for printing text with RGB colors in the console,"As a quick introduction:

I'm making my own writing software to write my science fiction story with. As I started out knowing nothing about the language back in August, I made the foolish decision to use as little third party libraries as possible (where sensible). This made me learn quite a lot about the language and how certain things work in the world of programming.

Last week I decided to replace my dependency on Colorama with my own package: **AthenaColor**

The library supports the same structure as Colorama (Fore, Back, Style), but with a much expanded color base. Namely I have chosen to predefine all expanded html colors in the Fore and Back colors.

All ANSI Select Graphic Rendition parameters are also implemented, yet most of them do not work in PyCharm. I've decided to put the ones that don't work in the PyCharm console under Style.Unverfified.

I'm also working on the capabilities to put in blinking text, and other similar methods, but these aren't within the project yet. When they are, I will update this post.

[A limited view of all predefined colors and all the Stylings you can do](https://preview.redd.it/s2is7qs2zyn81.png?width=1007&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c36ca104e1a04d41bd89d339d9932b32b2c68301)

The library also allows you to define custom RGB objects to use within the library, allowing you to print all 16.777.216 possible colors.(I've tried to make a print out in PyCharm of all these colors for fun, to see what would happen, and PyCharm doesn't like it when you try to do this)

reddit,Python,Is programming easy or am I doing things wrong?,"I started learning python around 5 months ago, with some breaks and inconsistency but for the last 2 months I have been steadily learning it, 4-10 hours daily. I am in a position where I am being mentored for a business sector that is really technology-based, so I am familiar with 'professional' programming costs and time frames.

One time, the owner talked about hiring a company to make a program/web app, so I took it as an opportunity to attempt to do the project myself, just as a learning opportunity. 

The quote was like tens of thousands of $$$, and they say it will take multiple months to do (not because they're booked up).

And this is something simple like following docs of another service to integrate with a very simple front-end and a decent SQL database. I just feel like I must be doing something wrong if it only takes me, a single person, a month and a half to have a complete product that works. 

I just don't understand how I can do it so quickly, but professional programmers take way longer and charge so much. Is there a reason? Such as multiple layers of protection from hiccups and bugs, etc.?Could it also be that I understand the software and they would need to delve into it more? Am I some genius programmer? /s but seriously, very curious and confused. (And I understand this can be a question that seems like a brag or something)

We're excited to release Composer ([https://github.com/mosaicml/composer](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer)), an open-source library to speed up training of deep learning models!

Composer lets you train:

* A ResNet-101 to 78.1% accuracy on ImageNet in 1 hour and 30 minutes ($49 on AWS), **3.5x faster and 71% cheaper than the baseline.**
* A ResNet-50 to 76.51% accuracy on ImageNet in 1 hour and 14 minutes ($40 on AWS), **2.9x faster and 65% cheaper than the baseline.**
* A GPT-2 to a perplexity of 24.11 on OpenWebText in 4 hours and 27 minutes ($145 on AWS), **1.7x faster and 43% cheaper than the baseline.**

Composer features a **functional interface** (similar to torch.nn.functional), which you can integrate into your own training loop, and a **trainer,** which handles seamless integration of efficient training algorithms into the training loop for you.

**Industry practitioners:** leverage our 20+ vetted and well-engineered implementations of speed-up algorithms to easily reduce time and costs to train models. Composer's built-in trainer makes it easy to **add multiple efficient training algorithms in a single line of code.** Trying out new methods or combinations of methods is as easy as changing a single list, and [we provide training recipes](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer#resnet-101) that yield the best training efficiency for popular benchmarks such as ResNets and GPTs.

**ML scientists:** use our two-way callback system in the Trainer **to easily prototype algorithms for wall-clock training efficiency.**[ Composer features tuned baselines to use in your research](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer/tree/dev/composer/yamls), and the software infrastructure to help study the impacts of an algorithm on training dynamics. Many of us wish we had this for our previous research projects!

reddit,Python,Writing production grade pandas with hamilton!,"While Pandas is incredibly flexible and easy to get started with, it doesn't lend itself to writing good quality, extensible code. This is usually fine. Lots of it is thrown away -- written in notebooks and never seen again. However, a  lot amount of it ends up making it into production ETLs, services, etc..

At Stitch Fix, we had a *lot* of monolithic, messy pandas scripts. We built [hamilton](https://github.com/stitchfix/hamilton/) to solve this problem. A programmer represents transforms on dataframes as a series of python functions. The parameter names are used to specify upstream dependencies, and the whole thing gets wired into a dependency graph.

In short -- instead of writing:

    df['a'] = df['b'] + df['c']

You'd write:

    def a(b: pd.Series, c: pd.Series) -&gt; pd.Series:
        return b+c

Then you use a *driver* to customize execution, pass in paraemeters, etc... Note that its not at all limited to pandas -- while that was the initial use-case, it can handle any sort of python datatype!

We've opened up this internal tool we're excited about to the outside world -- we'd love feedback, contribution, and use-cases!

reddit,Python,How do you really share constants across your project in a Pythonic way?,"Assuming i have a package i created who get input text, and return a huge dictionary with 50+ keys.

Since *all other packages* in the program are using this dictionary and play with those keys,  I don't want to hard code the keys, but keep them as global **constants**.

So here are my options and i feel uncomfortable with both of them:

1. Put all constants vars in a separate folder/package in root folder, and *import them to each package* that use them. To my eyes it makes the code **hairy and uncapsulated.** I love the SW engineering where you have a package that depend on nothing outside.
2. Pass all arguments in this config package to *each* package who need it - which also make things ugly hairy and confusing, and require putting all constants in a class(there are no structures.)

I know that most people go with **1**, but my code has like 10+ packages i wrote, each package has multiple files, ***each*** depend on these constants(50+), and if i import the constants (even with **absolute import**) to each, it makes me feel uncomfortable.

reddit,Python,Stylistic choice of validation functions,"Hey all! Got a question. I’m working on a validation script for work verifying some supplied input against required values. I’m wondering, stylistically, if there’s a “preferred way” to write these functions. 

An example function… 

    

    Def name_max_length(name): 
        if 1 &lt; len(name) &lt;= 128:
             return None

             raise     ValidationError(“Names length fell outside of max range.”) 



Apologies if Reddit mobile mangled that code but it’s short enough that I think everyone can still grok it. 

If you were working on a project would you want to see the above? Or would you rather read a single if statement, without an else, checking to see if it fell outside of the valid range and if so raise the exception. 

I thought PEP-8 had a stylistic recommendation about positive vs negative checking for if statements but I gave it a quick scan and didn’t see anything. I’m going to be writing a lot of these, so I’d like to get a solid stylistic choice under me. 

I’m also curious, would you rather see these ranges hard coded in the if statement, or see two local variables (min/max) and have “if”compare against those?",1647433601.0

* Set some constraints to determine if indeed an email can be sent.
* Either write up your email content when setting up a new email signal, or provide a path to a template.

Typesplainer is a Python type hint explainer that explains python type hints in plain English. It is very fast, accurate, and easy to use and understand. Available as a CLI, on the web, and as a Visual Studio Code extension

## Where

Website: https://typesplainer.herokuapp.com/\
CLI: https://pypi.org/project/typesplainer/\
Visual Studio Code extension (Alpha): https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WasiMaster.typesplainer

## Why

Wondering WTF is an `Callable[[List[int]], Dict[int, List[Union[str, None]]]]`? typesplainer has got you covered. It's a callable that accepts a list of integers and returns a dictionary that maps integers onto a list of optional strings. Understanding type hints can be hard and time-consuming, especially if they are very big like the example above. This tool helps you understand things like that more easily and faster.

## How

Just use the cli if you want to use it anytime and anywhere. Use the website to test the tool before installing or if you want a graphical interface. And since the vscode extension is still in development, I won't recommend that at the moment.",1647368487.0

reddit,Python,The Boilerplate for Logging in Python,"## Use this logging template in your next big project

Finding bugs is a common problem in any programming project. To make it easier to find bugs, you probably want to write some print statements to help you debug.

Is it helpful? yes. Is it the right way to track events in your code, especially in a big project? no.

Python has a built-in logging module that you can use to log messages. Logging not only helps you debug the issues in your code. It also helps you understand the flow of your code especially when you ship to production.

It is a very useful tool to identify how your code is behaving whether it is working as expected or not. If not, it can show you different hierarchies of how severe the issue is whether it is an error, a warning, or a debug mode.

Without having logging, it's difficult to keep your code maintainable for a long time. Especially when this code is mature.

In this tutorial, I'll show you a boilerplate for logging that you can use in your next project. Instead of looking at the documentation every time.

## Division Example
Let's take this division example especially when we divide by zero:
```python
def divide(dividend, divisor):
    try:
        return dividend / divisor
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return ""Zero Division error.""

print(divide(6, 0))
```
In this case, when we divided 6 by 0 we returned a message string. This message shows that a zero division error during the `ZeroDivisionError` exception occurred.

What's the problem with that? The issue here is that we don't know when that happened and how severe the issue is. Is it a warning? an error? or just a piece of information you're printing to the console?

The built-in Python's `logging` module helps you better log your code with its features. Let's see how we can use it in this context:
```python
import logging

# Define a logger instance
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
# Define a stream handler for the console output
handler = logging.StreamHandler()

# Customize the formatter on the console
formatter = logging.Formatter(
    ""%(asctime)s -  %(name)s: %(levelname)s - %(message)s"",
    datefmt=""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S""
    )
# Add the formatter to the handler
handler.setFormatter(formatter)

# Add the stream handler to the logger that we will use
logger.addHandler(handler)
# Set the level of logging to be INFO instead of the default WARNING
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

def divide(dividend, divisor):
    try:
        logger.info(f""Dividing {dividend} by {divisor}"")
        return dividend / divisor
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        logger.info(""Zero Division error."")

print(divide(6, 0))
```
which would return helpful information like this:
```
2022-02-23 13:24:41 -  __main__: INFO - Dividing 6 by 0
2022-02-23 13:24:41 -  __main__: INFO - Zero Division error.
```
## Wrap Up
In this boilerplate, you've seen how to log messages to the console. You've formatted the logs to start with a date and time followed by the name of the module, level of logging, and the log message itself.

Check out the [logger module here](https://gist.github.com/EzzEddin/0e8c517a47e678da6a60cc21fdbc5788) and let me know if you have any feedback, thanks!",1647357423.0
reddit,Python,"Python vs SQL for Data Analysis: comparing performance, functionality and dev XP","The clean division of data analysis labor between Python and SQL seems to be fading with tools like dbt, Snowpark and dask-sql. The article shared below compares the two languages in terms of performance, functionality and developer XP. 

Quick summary:

**Performance**  
Running SQL code on data warehouses is generally faster than Python for querying data and doing basic aggregations. This is because SQL queries move code to data instead of data to code. That said, parallel computing solutions like Dask and others that scale Python code to larger-than-memory datasets can significantly lower processing times compared to traditional libraries like pandas.

**Functionality**  
SQL’s greatest strength is also its weakness: simplicity. For example, writing SQL code to perform iterative exploratory data analysis, data science or machine learning tasks can quickly get lengthy and hard to read. Python lets you write free-form experimental data analysis code and complex mathematical and/or ML code. The absence of a vibrant and reliable third-party library community for SQL is also a problem compared to Python.

**Developer XP**  
Python makes debugging and unit-testing a lot easier and more reliable. While dbt has added code versioning by forcing the use of Git, SQL diffs are still harder to read and manipulate than diffs in Python IMO.

**Conclusion**  
While it's tempting to frame the debate between SQL and Python as a stand-off, the two languages in fact excel at different parts of the data-processing pipeline. One potential rule of thumb to take from this is to **use SQL for simple queries that need to run fast** on a data warehouse, **dbt for organizing more complex SQL models**, and **Python with distributed computing libraries like Dask for free-form exploratory analysis and machine learning code** and/or code that needs to be reliably unit tested.
